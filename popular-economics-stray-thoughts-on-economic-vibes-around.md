_Indian Bourses: Is there a Calm Before the Storm?_

Many of us wonder at the seeming disconnect between the stock market and the ground economic realities.  
  
Well, there are many obvious reasons and some not-so-obvious ones.  
  
There is a time lag between the reality and its impact on market dynamics. The aggregate market is much more emotionally matured than the individual players.  
  
Market has a longer term view as against traders motivated by day-to-day opportunities as they see with their limited perspectives.  
  
Further, market movements are dictated more by FPI flows and operations by large investors rather than retail investors. In times of crisis, DIIs do count a lot. The collective perception of the market players would obviously be more balanced than individual views. Hence market would appear at times to be in irrational stability!  
  
What investors must do is to use the opportunity provided by periodic swings to tidy up their portfolio and focus on a list of core investments they believe in. Beware that there are many bad apples in the basket. The cost of throwing out a few of them is worth it.  
  
Every storm is a passing one and no torrent has the fury to suppress human spirt. Move on, investors.
