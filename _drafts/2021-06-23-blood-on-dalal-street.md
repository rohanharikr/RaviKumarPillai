Ranjith has been working from home for well over a year now. Devoid of socialising and vacationing opportunities, he started a _demat account_ with a popular online trading portal and started actively trade. Like him many other professionals took to share market even as workplace environment remained elusive in the wake of extended lockdown. What started partly to overcome the boredom in having to confine to home and partly out of novelty value of an experience away from the work routines grew into a passion over the months.

When he called up and sounded alarmingly upset that morning, I had my work cut out – to help calm his nerves. Somehow, he had come to see me as a mentor of sorts not just at work but also off-work. _“I have just burned up ten lakh bucks, the stock market sucks”, he sounded desperate._

As it turned out, the stock market had a nasty, swift cut in the early minutes of opening that day. The sharp fall was centred around a clutch of prominent companies of a highly visible corporate group. **The trigger for the panic selling was apparently a damning article that highlighted the narrow public float and the concentrated holdings in these companies by a few off-shore investment firms.** A few of these firms had seemingly put virtually their entire funds in the stocks of the group.

I set out on my task of smoothening his ruffled feathers as best as I could. Much of what I told him has a larger appeal to individual investors, especially the newbies. So, let me put down the trail of my take on the stock market fiasco.

The bourses are not afraid to bleed. Periodic splurging of bad blood is a rejuvenation mechanism for stock markets around the world. It is a process integral to the maturing and sobering of market sentiments. When an unexpected flash of toxic news hits the market, the sentiments are soured in a huff. Shareholder wealth of billions of dollars evaporates into thin air in moments.

With the broadening of the investor base in NSE and BSE, the exposure to volatility risks has spread alarmingly to individual investors, especially small and first-time players in the capital market.

Many amateurish investors do indulge in futures and options and deploy leveraged funding. This adds to their woes in case of a sudden and violent slump. **The scramble for margin money can result in deep cuts in their personal savings.** This is what happened in the case of Ranjith too. _My advice to him was therefore to pare down exposure to futures. He sulked at the advice, reflective of the generation gap between the advisor and the advised._

To put him at ease and to provide a logical framework to my advice, I said, “Ranjit, if you have to understand a bit more about the risk-proneness of new retail investors in the market, we need to go back to the basics. Especially, the composition of the investment flows in to the bourses.” _The source, motives and methods of investments are the keys to the market susceptibilities._

We will try to make sense of the jigsaw puzzle of market volatilities by looking at three aspects of market dynamics. Between them, they hold the seeds of the periodic volatilities. Understanding them would bring ordinary individual investors to see ground realities through more realistic lenses.

_Firstly,_ let us demystify **the sources of investment flows**. Broadly, we can classify bulk of the funds coming into the bourses into three major categories – Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs), Domestic Institutional Investors (DII) and Retail Investors. Retail is an umbrella term and includes a wide range of market players from High Networth Individuals(HNIs) and Family Offices to the standalone individual investors.

“The retail is the smallest of the pool of investment capital. Of this, the stand-alone individual investor like you and me is at the bottom of the heap and is the most vulnerable lot,” I told Ranjith. _Obviously, individual investor has the least power to influence market movements and is rather at the receiving end of the underlying market dynamics._

**Foreign Institutional investments (FII) is the bedrock of Indian stock markets.** The ballooning of FII deployments in recent years _represents not any magical improvement in the corporate performance in India but rather the easing of global liquidity on the back of pandemic-driven loosening of purses by Central Banks of developed economies._ Much of this liquidity contributes to short-term funds that are as easily prone to disappear as quickly as the arrival. **The FII flows therefore add to the tentativeness of capital market pricing pressures.**

Liquidity-driven price movements was behind the dream run during past 12 to 18 months. And FIIs did call the shots. It created a schism between value and price of scrips - _even some penny stocks, representing near-bankrupt or apparently shaky businesses skyrocketed bringing a dizziness to price sensibilities._ While market volatilities are virtually dictated by the massiveness of the FII flows, retail investors are like floating logs in the flood of the mega trends!

Apart from FIIs, the most influential investment group comprises of the **DIIs (Domestic Institutional Investors)** comprising of Mutual funds, Insurance Sector, Pension and statutory social security funds. Banking and Corporate Treasury Management investments also sizeably impact market price and volume movements. DIIs pump in and suck out capital deployed on the bourses frequently.

On the average approx. Rs. 8000 to 10,000 Crores of transactions per day take place from both FII and DII investors per month in recent times. This generates vulnerabilities of swings in the price-volume- frequency triad . _While FIIs and DIIs may have a definite plan and act accordingly, the retail investors, the smaller ones, would be more of passive players and hence would face the brunt of sharp falls as part of the trade dynamics._

_Secondly,_ retail investors should attune to the **global business headwinds.** With escalating vaccination fulfilment, economies will return to normalcy over the next few months. **The supply and demand sides of the economy would recalibrate and a new reality and market equilibrium would emerge.** Factors such as interest rate tightening, liquidity moderating and commodity prices moving up might set the stage for a graded and prolonged recovery of global economy. China, USA, Europe and Japan would be under global watch to see the alacrity and resilience with which economies sprout back to life. Commodity prices – oil, metals and other commodities will be keenly watched for the price and volume trajectories.

_Thirdly,_ the **macroeconomic scenario of India** would influence market movements going forward. As for India, first the return of consumer demands for mass-consumption goods followed by surge in demand for durables as well as housing would be logical to expect. Infra and capital spending for capacity build-up would gather momentum in the second phase. If the third wave of pandemic does not happen or if it is handled with more finesse, the retrieval of demand and revenue growth would take markets on a more predictable growth path.

Going forward, the correction might linger and might hurt. Time has come for a portfolio rebalancing and tempering of sentiments to see that adverse impact of value fluctuations could be minimised. Purging of abnormally inflated stocks, pruning investments in groups and industry houses not known for ethical governance practices and focusing on scrips with value proposition and management quality would be a good strategy.

I saw that Ranjith had sobered a lot and probably the emotional response to market swing has given way to a more comprehensive understanding of market moves. “ Ranjith, now that you have taken the plunge, take care to align with market. See it as a beast that has its own logic and timing to throw tantrums occasionally. But being a long-term and relaxed investor, you need not be overly perplexed by ebbs and tides. _That is provided, you keep in mind that as a retail investor, you have to ride the market rather than influence it.”_

Being light, agile, alert and active would ensure that you handle the inevitable risks with calm and balanced approach. Commit yourself to v**alue investing, ethical investing and conviction investment.**

Do your research and select a small group of stocks to track – if you spread too thin, your ability to handle fluctuations in price would be affected. Be guided by your conviction of the intrinsic worth and future potential of the underlying business. Keep ethics and consistency of the leadership of the businesses you would invest in. Temper your expectations to reasonable growth – speculation is risky, infectious and could lead to irrational expectations.

Air pockets, dark clouds and rough waves cannot be avoided. But an investor needs to live with the turbulence though disciplined investment.

Hope like Ranjith some of you too would find a few of these ideas to sober your investment habits.
