If there is one thing common between Nehru and Modi it is that both made sincere attempts to cultivate what they believed to be a natural and sustainable friendship between India and China. Both were back-stabbed by the dragon with its wry and deceptive smile.

**China has come a long way from being an outcast on the margins of legitimacy to be a global power awaiting the crowning as _‘numero uno’_ in global economy.** In spite of a history of suppressed human rights at home and outright muscle flexing on global arena, how did China succeed in its obsessive pursuit of power so far? It would remain an enigma of human history how Chinese Communist Party turned an intrinsically humanistic economic philosophy of Karl Marx into a medium to shore up its version of crass nationalism and couched capitalism. Even Marx might turn in his grave at the Chinese marauding of his concept universal working-class unity transcending nationhood.

Bullies are created when they are empowered by circumstances and myopic public opinion to brazenly challenge norms, conventions and decorum. It is ironic that the world’s largest democracy and the world’s most powerful democracy played key roles in bestowing legitimacy and empowerment to a beleaguered Peoples’ Republic of China (PRC). When the United Nations was set up, China (Republic of China-ROC) was made one of the five permanent members, because among other reasons the USA saw the move as a counter weight to its arch-rival of the time, Russia. However, after the Revolution led by Mao Zedong and the establishment of PRC in mainland China, ROC operated from Taiwan and continued as a Permanent member of the UN, though without any clout comparable to the other four permanent members. India was offered by the US to take up the seat replacing ROC as one of the five Permanent Members. But Nehru saw it as an unethical move and was against upsetting the sensitives of the beleaguered PRC. He declined to take up the offer. China repaid the unwavering support of Nehru by launching a crushing military attack and capturing a large chunk of India in 1962. The immediate provocation was again the humanitarian gesture by Nehru of granting asylum to the persecuted Holy Dalia Lama of Tibet. The Indian territory still in China’s possession as of now is larger than the state of Kerala. **In one of the many ironies of history, non-aligned India and pacifist Nehru became instrumental for the early vetting of the Chinese thirst for blood. The bully of later years was baptized.**

India was the first nation in the world to recognize PRC. If Nehru played a part in imparting political legitimacy to PRC, it was left to Richard Nixon, the US President known more for Watergate scandal, to handhold China into diplomatic prominence. Nixon became the first US President in history to visit China in 1971. On Oct. 25, 1971, the United Nations General Assembly voted to admit the People's Republic of China and to expel the Republic of China. Eight years later, President Jimmy Carter formally recognized People’s Republic of China (PRC) with effect from 1, January, 1979.

It was the persistent lobbying by American business - which senses a huge market in the vast Communist republic - that pushed the cascading events in favour of China. US diplomats saw the opportunity to corner the Cold War foe USSR by fostering China as a counterweight. **What India, a liberal democracy of huge size could not achieve, was a relative cakewalk for the totalitarian state. **China managed not only to wriggle out of isolation but to position itself as a beneficial business destination for US companies.

While China mastered power politics and economic enticement to win over the mecca of capitalism, India cemented its image as a soft, and in the eyes of many global observers, a weak, lethargic third world nation in the mould of many newly independent African and Asian countries. If we wove an entropy of status quo and mediocrity around our global image, those who wielded power for decades should answer.

In the intriguing tale of the ascendancy of China, **the innumerable occasions they used veto power as permanent member to scuttle India’s strategic interests in the UN accentuate our helpless image.**

How do we deal with the current China with its unabashedly aggressive posturing and ambitious economic adventurism? In the context of the current geopolitics, most of the Asian and African economies have become firmly entrenched in the Chinese debt net. The Belt and Road Initiatives, ostensibly to revive the legendary silk rout to rejuvenate global trade, is in reality proving to be a noose around the neck of many nations enticed by the Chinese whisper. Some like Pakistan and Sri Lanka are in the course of diving into depths of debt while their economies come increasingly in the grip of Chinese companies.

**In today’s global supply chain, businesses in US, Europe or in India have a heavy dependence on China** for sourcing parts, components and intermediaries. Chinese investment globally, including in India, is quite high and well dispersed among sectors. Indian companies have also leveraged their positions in Chinese market. Global trade is intricately meshed into a cross-border value chain and fund flow. It is no longer feasible or advisable to regress into an inward-looking isolation in today’s connected world.

**In this situation, dealing with China has to be done with resolute calmness, strategic maturity and outright pragmatism.** Gone are the days when emotions could dictate a tit-for-tat adversity. Our national aspirations are global and our current opportunities are immense to grab a much more influential share of global value chain. _Creating an atmosphere of unease and uncertainty about India is exactly the game plan of China_ as it is rattled by the possibility of losing out the label of the unquestioned manufacturing base for the world. It is in our long-term interest to project India as reliable, secure and strong partner for manufacturing, trade and services. Composure, resilience and long-term focus are signs of potential winners.

**Hawkish talk of immediate retaliation is not a winner’s strategy. The competent and confident player bides time and strikes with force.** China needs to be played with the same cunning variations in strategy and strike as it displays. China maneuvered into a position of strength early in the mind game with India by branding Pakistan as ‘all-weather friend.’

We need to cultivate a larger, reliable and globally spread circle of friends and strategic partners and also help Indian private corporate sector to enhance their global reach and influence. We need to craft sustainable alliances and partnerships with strong economies not necessarily limited to US.

_Acupuncture is a Chinese treatment that involves inserting very thin needles through a person’s skin at specific points on the body, to various depths._ It goes by the logic that pain cures pain. For China’s illogical and narcissist global transgressions, it needs to be paid back in its own medicine. But the challenge is to do it with finesse, taking global sensitivities and our own geo-political and commercial interests into account.

I have tried to list down my perspective of a **five-point strategy for dealing with China**. The original _panchsheel_ proposed by Nehru failed because it was built on emotional premises ignoring possible realpolitik undercurrents. We need to reset the strategic framework to take on a belligerent dragon.

_Firstly,_ **strengthen our military capabilities and infrastructure** in visible and substantial terms. **Upgrade border surveillance** deploying state-of-the art technology.

_Secondly,_ **cut off the long rope given by us to fledgling nations trying to curry favors with China**; forget about ‘long standing relations’, if they only hurt us. We all know who plays the strings when we see contrived chicanery from unexpected quarters that thrived for years on Indian hospitality.

_Thirdly_, **boost Indian economic and commercial interests in the vast hinterland** where the Chinese have been grazing with greed for years. Leverage the Indian corporate strengths in sectors like construction and manufacturing and bolster the funding pipeline. Forge transnational consortia with countries and institutions for third country investments.

_Fourthly,_ **show pragmatism and flexibility to separate economic and political sides of our China relations.** We must increase and not reduce mutual economic engagement with China and take it to a point where we make the balance of payment in our favour. _Make the corporate and trade ties so strong that China would find it difficult to bully us into submission_ because their business would get hurt more than ours. For years US and China followed a love-hate relationship while mutual economic interactions thrived. When business and income are involved, negotiations do get sobered. Rocking the boat is not a matured option for either side.

_Fifthly,_ **hurt China most where they are most vulnerable**. They are overly sensitive to the chorus of **human rights abuses and oppressive political management of dissent in China**. We should play mind- games with the same dexterity and sharpness as they do. We should use our strengths as an open, liberal democracy to highlight, influence and encourage the ‘people issues’ in China that get swept under the carpet in the totalitarian culture there.

India and China together have a population of 2.8 Billion – we are home to 38% of the world population. We are neighbors with long shared boundary. _There is simply no way we can and should live in perpetual animosity at the people-to-people level._

**In 1957, China forcibly occupied and built roads in Aksai Chin area; India came to know of it after one full year. We have come a long way from that position.** Today, we are able to set the agenda, push our infrastructure in the border areas aggressively.

Yet, we have miles to go. But our path should be far from blind confrontation or meek submission. When a strong nation talks, the world listens. Let us aspire to be heard; let us talk sense with calm and firmness.
