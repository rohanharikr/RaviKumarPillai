We were having our sporadic weekend old boys’ meetup, a rare fixture in these days of pandemic. The freewheeling discussions touched upon a range of topics. May be triggered by the prevailing social milieu or in an accidental detour, we stumbled upon an interesting, yet uncomfortable, question.

_“Are you a nationalist?” , asked my effervescent friend. “ Well, I don’t think so,” I replied. “Okay, then you are not patriotic?”, pat came the response._ Though my temptation was to feign inattentiveness in a bid to avoid the futile discussion forward, my spontaneous response was, **“Well, patriotism itself is a bit worn-out idea. Nevertheless, how the hell are you equating nationalism with patriotism?”**

Thankfully, the discussions took a fast retreat from the alley that poetically would have led to fierce posturing. Later that night as I lay gazing at the emptiness of the enveloping darkness, that evening’s fleeting discussions triggered stray thoughts on the whole issue of virulent nationalism.

_What is nationalism, anyway? Is it positive or inherently divisive? Can there be a world beyond nationalism?_ These nagging questions are inconvenient and disturbing and so most people conveniently avoid them even in their self-talk.

Nationalism as a concept evolved as a result of the _search for identity and affiliation_ of the early tribal and clannish societies. As they struggled to fend off external invasions and intimidations by others seeking to establish their own moorings and dominance. Historically, as nomads and colonisers gobbled up contiguous geographies for farming, settlement and assertion of power, the idea of nationalism took roots in different hues and haze. **Both the invaders and the locals crafted their own notions and folklore around the valour, supremacy and traditions of their kind ‘nationalism’ took shape. The notions of us and them got accentuated through the reinforcement of nationalism.**

It is an irony that nationalism which got established as a shield of inclusive identity ended up thriving on a number of corollary ideas of antithesis - exclusion, hostility and intolerance towards diversity_. If one looks behind the veil of the superficial unity brought out by the neo-nationalist movements across the world, one would discern icy, power struggles and domineering individual assertions by interest groups and lobbyists._

Nationalism thus evolved as a supremacist, self-serving and power-anchored idea to bolster the political powers that held sway at the instant period of history.

_Over the course of evolution of humanity, geographical and lifestyle identities gave way to religion and belief systems as the overarching layer of identity._ While religion intertwined with political nationalism in the pre-liberal era, subsequently religion and statecraft developed a working arrangement of mutual exclusiveness at least in theory. The monarchies which ruled most settlements before the onset of democratic liberalism were quick to sense the utility of religious and ethnic identities as powerful means to divide, insulate and subjugate the masses thereby fending of simmering discontent and anti-incumbency in the medium term.

As humanity journeyed into the 19th century and beyond, nationalism of the tribal variety gave way to economic nationalism. The new idea of nationalism based on economic domains was consistent with the better educated, diversely skilled and aspirational generations. I believe that **whatever humanity has achieved in terms of physical and social well-being since Industrial Revolution is largely the result of free thinking, openness to see ‘the other’ perspectives and unbridled inquisitiveness.** _More than “Why”, it is “Why not” that has shaped the modern society._

As perspectives broadened and the scope of interactions widened, we saw the blossoming of the age of liberalism. Conservative Right, Liberal Centre and a minority deviant Left ideology learned to live and let live. Democracy came to be accepted as the more humane, accommodative and acceptable way of governance.

**However, the politics of exclusions, privileges and fictitious cultural supremacy still hold sway among a sizeable number of conformists who view change as unnecessary, non-divine and too disturbing.** Divisive nationalism is fanned by traditionalists across geographies. While liberal democracies still provide space to the ultra-right, in many geographies ruled by autocratic despots, military generals or by puppet regimes propped up by the military, fierce nationalism founded on exclusion of non-conformists still prevails as a means for status-quoist political power. _The continuing stories of threats, devastation and human sufferings in the name of religious, political or pseudo-cultural divisions speak of the hold of primitive tribalism over the presumably modern societies._

Look at history’s catastrophic failures such as Hitler’s Germany, Tsarist Russia or Chinese Empire – _all of them suffered interminably from inflated self-image of cultural supremacy and the myth of infallibility of the ruling dispensation._ **Excessive and impassioned nationalism and pumped-up adulation for the glory of the past spelled disaster, humiliation and demise of many a political dispensation in the long and chequered history of humanity.**

In contemporary societies, nationalism’s vitriolic divisiveness is still exploited by politicians. Religious nationalism and even sub-regional identity politics based on caste, language and sects come in handy for cunning politicians to carve out and nurture vote banks. _Nationalism and the stratification of the same along divisive identities eat into the cohesion of societies and hamper the potential for unifying and secular agenda for development._

**Today’s world presents immense possibilities for skilling, entrepreneurship, mobility and cross-border commerce on the back of digital connectivity and applications. When the knowledge ecosystem has potential to deliver unprecedented opportunities for upward social and economic mobility, it is indeed an anachronism to allow narrow and restrictive notions of nationalism to apply brakes on progress and prosperity.**

“Nationalism is a psychological aberration, and we owe it to our ancestors, and to our descendants - and to the other species, and to the Earth itself - to move beyond it”, says Steve Taylor of Leeds Beckett University who authored the book ‘The Leap and Spiritual Science’

India’s age-old cultural moorings are on _‘vasudhaiva kudumbakam’ (The World is one large family)._ **Developing global perspectives, cultivating inclusiveness and feeling proud about the diversity of our society are critical for our deliverance from the entropy of poverty and mediocrity.**

Just like nationalism, patriotism too is a two-edged sword. **Patriotism is indeed a very subjective idea that can be conveniently defined and brandished. In most imperfect ideologies, patriotism is used as a term to count you in as a supporter of the ruling dispensation or against it.** _In a sense, patriotism has restrictive overtones that are anathema to the concept of universal brotherhood._ When the ruling class usurps the moral authority to determine who is patriot and who is not, the concept is extinguished at one go.

In my interactions with a number of educated and intelligent youngsters, _I am pained to see a creeping willingness to accept, support and propagate politics of hate, exclusion and cultural divisiveness. It is unfortunate and myopic._

**I would rather be a non-nationalist and a humanist at heart.** A global citizen at best, who is equally disturbed by a pair of sunken eyes in Africa and by the sight of hungry children struggling to grab a food dole-out in an anonymous Indian city.
