Over the past few years, much bad blood has been shed in India-China bilateral relations.

Even before China became the leading factory hub of the world and flooded the global markets with mass merchandise, the Sino-Indian relations that started in the 1950s with an exuberant warmth had soured badly. The unfortunate transgressions of 1962 by the People’s Liberation Army to the utter bewilderment of the ill-prepared Indian troops were just the beginning.

Succession of Chinese regimes under the Communist rule displayed an uncanny knack to exploit the legacy geopolitical fault lines in the sub-continent. The term “all weather friendship” was coined to define China-Pakistan ties mainly to rub salt into the wounded Indian ego rather than out of any long-term love for our Western neighbour. The contributory negligence of ruling dispensations in India and the lack of political bilateralism within the country on strategic neighbourhood relationships have only accentuated the frosty vibes between India and China.

_Indian fear of being overrun by the growing clout of the larger neighbour in military might, diplomatic clout and global trade has often led to paranoid responses when stern and gutsy posturing was called for. Much water has flown down Ganges since 1962._

**The tactical significance of a working relationship and search for common ground for Indian and Chinese interests have assumed global significance now.** To be fair to PM Modi, he did bend backwards to please President Xi. But nothing seems to have worked and the Chinese have carried on playing up the regional tensions to their perennial advantage. Their massive economic advantage has allowed them the luxury of using ‘loose purse strings’ to ride rough shod over the vast hinterland of Africa and the less-developed Asia, which are desperately dry of capital for growth.

_The beauty about realpolitik and global diplomatic undercurrents is that these are ever in a state of flux._ The pandemic-induced economic moderation, the creeping realisation that fast-paced Chinese economic expansion of cannot be sustained and the unexpected loss of face that China encountered in their adventurous military moves in the Himalayan valleys have all brought the dragon on to tactical re-posturing.

**There seems to be a realistic reset of the Chinese aggressiveness.** I would read this tactical cooling-off reflected by Chinese retreat from its Himalayan adventurism as a window of opportunity that India should grab. We need to iron out the creases and smoothen the relationship with China to a win-win mode .

**I believe that China and India would do well to search for synergies and complementarities in commercial and economic relationship.** Together these giant economies that are home to over 2.5 billion human beings can be a tremendous force in asserting the Asian prowess. **An India-China economic partnership, if sensitively calibrated can be a gamechanger. It can positively impact much of the global population much beyond both the countries -** _covering Africa, Middle East, East Asia and Central Asia._

For the following reasons, I am all for using the opportunity provided by the tactical retreat of Chinese military from the border areas for giving another chance to peace and progress.

Firstly, **as the world struggles to get back to normalcy post-Covid, India and China need each other in a complementary partnership to spur their domestic growth and renewal.** _The combine market is huge in size. Both India and China can gain from collaboration and increased trade._ But to succeed the new paradigm needs to be built up on trust, sharing and long-term perspectives.

India should be able to gain enhanced access to Chinese markets in the sectors in which we hold competitive and strategic advantages- like pharma, IT and value-added commodity intermediaries. Likewise, we need Chinese investment and expertise in infrastructure projects and manufacturing of technology products for the world. **When cooperation can benefit both the economies in terms of huge economic value addition, frittering away the chances for a few political brownie points does not make sense.**

_Secondly,_ **China has proven expertise in high-tech logistics, manufacturing and construction** and have implemented many landmark projects in many parts of the world, mostly in Africa, Middle East and developing Asia. We need to leverage the Chinese strengths for fast-tracking our infrastructure upgrade. Keeping China away is like throwing the baby with the bath. If you look at how China built up their competitive position and business depth with the US, they have used tactical agility, accommodation and openness, while keeping their subtle strategic nuances deftly.

**There are tremendous opportunities for Indian corporates and Chinese entities to collaborate in building infra projects and participate in the massive privatisation of Public Enterprises.** Where regulatory framework needs to be redefined, fine-tuned and strengthened to prepare the ground that should be done forthwith.

_Thirdly,_ **China and India seem to be competing fiercely – sometimes not entirely fairly - for strategic ties and commercial contracts in Africa and other developing countries**; With both Governments implementing confidence building measures, the companies in India and China can benefit and the cost and efficiency of the projects in third countries can greatly improve.

_Fourthly,_ **a positive and constructive relationship between India and China can help the South Asia Region as a whole tremendously.** For example, to get India and Pakistan to a level of being partners in progress rather than living on perpetual shadow of partition, I strongly believe China – if it can act genuinely in statesman-like role- has a significant role to play a positive role. If China sees genuine and sustainable economic advantages in cooperating with India, they would play a more supportive role in normalising India-Pakistan relations. In fact, Pakistan needs to also think beyond its past bitterness with India because keeping the fires of hate and hurt does not help people or nations to progress.

_Fifthly,_ **raising the comfort level with China will smoothen India getting back to Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP)** which remains an unfinished agenda without our participation. India being part of RCEP and allaying India’s genuine concerns for ensuring smooth integration into the partnership would be a win-win for China, India and the other ASEAN countries.

With Xi and Modi in charge, it looks possible to erase the scars in the relationship and give a fresh start of positive collaboration. China has as much to gain from the massive economic opportunities that India offers as we have opportunities for leveraging China’s capital, expertise and market access. The immediate priority should be to build trust and enhance genuine mutuality. **An assertive Asia can pull not just the immediate neighbourhood, but even Africa and much of the less-developed Middle East from the current economic slump.**

I know there would be many naysayers in India who feel comfortable to remain wrapped in the frigidities of the past. An improved relationship with China is definitely a great opportunity for us and much less of a threat. **Considering that we have wasted nearly seven decades in bickering and playing shadow fights, I believe we should give a serious chance to bringing China onboard as a dependable partner in economic and commercial spheres.**
