Crystal gazing has always been fascinating. Especially in macro-economics. It has attracted academicians, thought leaders and policy planners the world over.

The world is in the grip of heightened anxiety about launch of Covid vaccines and resumption of activities hampered by lockdowns. People are eagerly waiting to get back to their comfort levels in lifestyles and work routines.

Several factors are at play in today’s complex global economic realities. In addition to extensive pandemic disruptions, the geopolitical situation is in turmoil too. China’s increasing military and commercial muscle-flexing and its aggressive infrastructure investments with potential to push smaller beneficiary nations into debt-trap are factors to reckon with. The long-held regional and global perception of the dragon as the growth engine for economic growth is fast giving way to  apprehensions about Chinese strategic intentions. There are worrying signs of growing commercial hostilities between China and the major economies.

Both these factors - the _pandemic and reassessment of China’s strategic global role_ - together are redrawing the contours of political and economic relations among nations.

**It is not anybody’s case that global economy is stuck in a blackhole. The pandemic will pass, economies would recover and start their next up move sooner than later.** What is quite likely however is that nations and economies who would be the potential winners in the emerging scenario would in all likelihood be a newer set of nimbler and more adaptive ones rather than the traditional front-runners. 

Ruchir Sharma, Chief Global Strategist and Head of Emerging Markets Equity at [Morgan Stanley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morgan_Stanley "Morgan Stanley") Investment Management, brought us an objective ringside view of global economy in his two well-researched books _The Rise and Fall of Nations: Forces of Change in a Post-Crisis World_ and [_Breakout Nations_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakout_Nations "Breakout Nations") _._ Ruchir’s books have helped readers like me to align our exuberant optimism on the future of Indian economy with the ground realities and peer group benchmarks.

His latest book is now available and it has not come a day too soon. In _The 10 Rules of Successful Nations (Penguin Publishing 2020),_ he looks at the likely winners in the global economy as it would emerge on the other side of the current imbroglio.

He identifies four key factors as the differentiators that could propel the new set of winning economies – _Competent Government, Low Debt levels, Domestic Strength of the economy and Technical Sophistication._

Structural resilience, leadership quality - consensus building and ability to pursue solutions that might entail short-term pains for longer-term good – contribute significantly to **governance competence.** More than processes and systems, behavioral and communication dimensions of transformational leadership contribute to sustainable rebound.

Keeping internal and external **debts at manageable levels** **viz-a-viz GDP** and the ability to stretch **fiscal and monetary policies** to support quicker turnaround are indeed significant in confronting the unprecedented crisis that nations are facing. 

**Domestic economic strength** includes factors like breadth and depth of the economy, liquidity and market resilience as well as favorable demographic factors. 

The most important of the success factors  in the increasingly digitalising eco-system of today is  **technical sophistication of the infrastructure, skill sets and behaviors.**

_Economies that curate and reward technology innovations are undoubtedly going to be the leaders of tomorrow._ In spite of the lack of open market structure or individual freedoms that a liberal society offers, China went on to become a global economic power due mainly to the support and facilitation for technology innovation, research, scale up that the nation provided. _Mass education and skill development ensured massive human capital development even in the vast hinterland._ The share of GDP that India allocates to education, research and technology/skill development would pale into insignificance in comparison to what China and most East Asian economies have consistently been spending.

Ruchir Sharma applies the ten rules of economic success that he elaborates in his book to identify the top 25 nations most likely to emerge winners in the competitive race to economic success.

India figures at  rank 13, not quite unexpectedly though. There is a mediocrity fixation and lack of competitive aggressiveness that have been the bane of our society for years. 

_The surprise lies in the list of top three winning economies_. **Globally, the top three ranks go to Germany, Finland and Switzerland.** They score high notably on the strength of technical excellence, culture of innovation and the culture of consensus leadership.

Notably, _the United States and China do not figure in the top._ As for the US, technology dominance would still be there. But on economic responses to contingencies and governance leadership, the US has been on a slide. **There perhaps was never a time when the domestic politics in America was as polarised and hostile as now.** Geopolitical power of the US has eroded considerably under Trump’s boisterous and unpredictable leadership. **As for China, success has gone to its head and its ambition to rule the world has blinded the present leadership to unabashed arrogance.**

Here, the global context does present a window of opportunity for India to leapfrog into big ticket growth. But the hard truth is that the rest of the world would rather pass over India and opt for more benign and accommodative environment of the far eastern breakout nations when looking for alternative locations for ‘China plus One’ de-risking.

The bureaucratic snarls, slow pace of infrastructure development and lack of skilled manpower make global manufacturers jittery in setting shop extensively in India. **The thee Asian emerging Economies in the best position to succeed in the post Covid economic resurgence would be Vietnam, Taiwan and ,surprise of surprises, Putin’s Russia.** The regimented discipline and strong streak of assertiveness by political leadership can catapult Russia to the list of achieving economies.  

**Political consensus on economic development has always eluded India. In the game of one-upmanship, there is a scramble among parties to appear politically correct.** _It is next to impossible for the Indian politicians to take tough decisions, all the more so because every now and then there is an election in some part of India._ Structurally, socially and culturally, India is a hard nut to crack when it comes to a focussed transformation program.

History may not offer another opportune moment for a full throttle push to clear the unfinished economic reform agenda and put the nation on road to prosperity and sustainable growth. 

Illusions of cultural greatness and nostalgia of past glories don’t make nations. Commitment and perseverance would. As we see the miracle of the resurgent Vietnam unfold in front of our eyes, let us look inward and ask, _“Are we measuring up to the task?”_
