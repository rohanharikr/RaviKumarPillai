_"Traditional conglomerates have no future. On average, they are average. And today, average means mediocracy" - Joe Kaeser, CEO of Siemens_

The top ten Indian companies by market capitalisation as of Feb/2021 reads: _RIL, TCS, HDFC Bank, Infosys, HUL, HDFC, Kotak Mahindra Bank, SBI, Bajaj Finance and Bharti Airtel._

**The list is dominated overwhelmingly by pure-play enterprises rather than business conglomerates.** We have many legacy industrial houses which have grown haphazardly like wild bushes mostly in the pre-liberalisation years. Many of them accumulated licences/permits and grew into unwieldy behemoths.

However, _it goes to the credit of free market dynamics and the gradual maturing of capital markets in the country that many of them lost out to the newer, nimbler and more focused businesses over time._

Why is it that large business houses with an assortment of businesses in their portfolio seem less appealing to discerning investors? Some of the key factors for the loss of investor interest in them are rigidity of their corporate structure, power-centric governance processes, blurring of strategic focus and dilution of economic value accretion due to non-synergic businesses.

Globally, the strategic weight of the conglomerate business model has been on the decline. **In the US and in Europe since 1980s, companies have preferred the stand-alone business format to the group structure.**

_Rise in_ _activism against monopoly practices_ and the _perception of incremental shareholder value in decoupling of sunrise businesses from the legacy_ _ones_ were the key drivers behind this shift. Further, standalone business structure _better aligns with the sector-specific interests. Management and regulatory processes are a lot less complex_ for standalone enterprises compared to the group entities.

**It is time for large business houses to relook at their business model and to take a call on strategic restructuring.** This is needed to regain the animal spirit that spurred them to expansion in the first place. The context has changed and   new challenges have emerged. _Digitalisation opportunities, generational shift in talent and leadership as well as fast-changing competitive landscape_ call for **agility, collaboration and customer alignment** for survival and growth.

Group level consolidation as a model and strategy merits a fresh and objective look. Before we take up a few examples from the contemporary corporate landscape, we need to understand clearly the concept of _conglomerate discount._

The enterprise valuation of a conglomerate is done by aggregating the ‘sum-of-parts’ value of individual businesses in the group. **Analysts tend to assign a lesser value to the consolidated business at the group level compared to the sum total of the enterprise values of business verticals.** Lack of synergy across businesses,  performance lags and cyclical variations  of different businesses result in possible depletion of the overall valuation.

**In this age of super specialisation and digitalisation, small is indeed more beautiful and more effective. Giant corporates tend to be too slow to respond to sudden changes in the business environment.**

There are some vital learning points as we review the list of top market cap companies.

_Take the case of ITC._ It has been consistently coming down in the pecking order and has disappeared from the list of 2020. What do you think would have gone wrong when it comes to how the investment community perceives it?

_Well, ITC’s core business of cigarettes is under perennial regulatory threat_ and has serious constraints on future growth potential. However, it has ventured into diverse and unconnected sectors like hospitality where it finds the going tough. **The FMCG business is indeed doing well but in the absence of unlocking through demerger, the massive potential for growth is stymied.**

_Further, look at Reliance Industries_. In spite of figuring at the top of the table, _the sectoral valuation in respect of its Oil and Petrochemicals, Telecom and Retail verticals are at varying stages of maturing and the consolidation at apex level  depresses the aggregate economic value below its potential._  The slow monetisation of fibre-to-the-home network and  uncertainties regarding 5G are drags on valuation.

In the short-term till the demerger and listing of Jio platform, the enterprise value is likely to be seen as subdued by the market. The much-hyped possible investment by global Oil majors seems mired in near-term uncertainty too. _As of now, RIL to me is like a student with high potential performing below par in exams._

_Larsen and Toubro(L&T) offers another perspective in enterprise value unlock._ It has done well to list L&T Infotech (LTI), L&T Tech. Services (LTTS) and L&T Financial Holdings (LTFH) as separate entities. _The incremental shareholder value created by these strategic listings is significant_. Look at how the market cap of LTI has soared for example. However, the parent company is still struggling to find its moorings due to the disruptions in order flow and delays in execution pipeline. Any upward mobility in market capitalisation would be in sync with post-Covid recovery of infra spending. 

Yet another example is the consistent accretion to share holder value as well as the road map for future demerger and monetisation of businesses likely in Adani Enterprises.   Their strategy demonstrates a marked preference for pure-play business model post the incubation and curation phase of new businesses.  This would be positive for investor value build-up.  

What do all these examples throw up as lessons for the conglomerates in India?

Firstly, **sticking to core competencies is vital for corporate identity and value creation in an increasingly competitive and connected economy.**

Strategy Consulting firms recommend that enterprises with unwieldy and unproductive portfolio should prune their offerings to a viable and critical range. _As a thumb rule, if you are not in the top three (or at least top five) players in the sector, it is prudent for you to exit._ This is a pragmatic touchstone for assessing and recalibrating strategies of conglomerates.

The story of how the rush of telecom licence aspirants spoiled the show and burned their pockets when India liberalised telecom sector will ever remain as a rude reminder of the dangers of crony capitalism and investment adventurism. 

_The strategic focus  of Tata Group on reinforcing the verticals and enabling the growth of independent businesses needs to be commended._ Having inducted youthful leaderships and cleaned up the strategy and processes, the group seems to have enabled standalone companies to pursue market dominance and execution excellence.

_Secondly,_ **the strategic need for conglomerates today is to leverage technology, talent and leadership to capitalise on the emerging  opportunities for growth.**  Digital transformation is critical to the evolution of conglomerates into a few robust pure-play businesses. 

The age of the big and overbearing conglomerates is over. Now is the time for compact, focused and agile corporations.
