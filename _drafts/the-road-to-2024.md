The next General Elections in India is nearly three years away. Crystal-gazing across the run up to 2024 is both intriguing and sensitive.

Before we identify a few trends and likely developments in the run up to 2024, let us set the context in which the next elections would possibly take place.

The pandemic has already destroyed the financial stability of millions of low-income Indians – migrant labour, contract workers, self- employed, small businessmen and more. **Currently in its second wave, we are still unsure of the trajectory of virus mutations in the near to medium term future.**

With substantial population yet to be vaccinated and apparently more virulent mutants of the virus feared to emerge in India and abroad, we have to learn to adjust our economy, life and governance to coexist with the lingering threat.

We may spend possibly another year or even more in this state of ‘suspended animation’; hence in all probability we would be facing 2024 national elections not in a staid political mode. Let us look at the emerging _economic and political scenario_ riddled with imponderables on the way to the next general election season.

_Economically_, **the role of the State has become central to the survival and hope of ordinary citizens not just in India but around the world.** Regardless of the ideological leanings of ruling dispensations or the ability of public exchequer to support the population most vulnerable to sustenance woes, governments have little choice but to up the funding for _food security, public health, grass-root liquidity support and boosting digital infrastructure and governance_.

**In the near term, job creation and infrastructure build-up would depend much more heavily on public spending since** private investment and capital flows would be under strain due to overall economic slump.

Indian economy was already slowing down before the pandemic struck. The economic renewal agenda that was expected to be implemented - strategic privatisation, increased foreign direct investment in core sectors, mega manufacturing projects to benefit from global ‘China Plus One’ push and investment to bridge the infrastructure deficit are all at risk of being pushed back. More fundamental survival and livelihood issues have relegated project spending in priority.

_Whatever economic recovery would ensue in the coming two to three years would likely fall short of mitigating the woes of the pandemic slump felt far and wide across sectors and regions._ **In all probability therefore, 2024 elections would take place not in the best of macroeconomic climate in the country.**

_Politically,_ **the current scenario is akin to a tennis game where the champion defending the title has suddenly confronted an unexpected ‘deuce’.** The next few months would determine the shape and intensity of the electoral battle of 2024.

An optimistic assumption is that the pandemic might get tamed and the third wave, if and when it happens, would hopefully be met with better preparedness both by federal and state governments. However, the possible worsening of the pandemic blues cannot be wished away either. _Preparedness is the name of the game._ **The political build-up to 2024 elections would be dictated by the hits and misses in the federal and state governments’ handling of the pandemic and its economic fallouts.**

The outcome of elections to some key states in the coming two years would set the stage for the Big Event. **How the confidence, brand equity and leadership credibility of the key parties would emerge from these state elections would determine the tactics for the big national showdown.** Of course, UP elections will be “the mother of all elections.” Post UP elections, the headwinds in Indian politics will follow the direction it points to.

In India, _mostly elections are not won by one party or alliance , but are lost by the other formation._ Negative votes and faltering sentiments are key to election outcomes. Anti-incumbency and short-term unease are significant triggers for electoral ebbs and tides.

In the background of the above economic and political realities, I am venturing to identify the five most defining trends that might set apart the 2024 elections from the run-of-the-mill stereotype. These may be proved wrong by unexpected turn of events in the reminder of the current government’s terms.

_Firstly,_ **the era of one-party rule that dawned in 2014 quite unexpectedly on the back of the refreshing, high-decibel and invigorated campaigning of Narendra Modi seems to have run its course.** _India would in all probability return to coalition politics in 2024._ The strengthening of regional voices and the play of anti-incumbency portend to a break with monolithic national party dominance. With Congress weakening still on course and growing disillusionment with BJP’s ‘one-size-fit-all’ approach, the field is wide open for a period of loose and possibly shaky alliance politics.

_Secondly_, not only will we return to coalition politics but **the say of regional politics on the national stage would become more pronounced.** The emerging coalitions on either side of the political divide may see powerful regional satraps with sizeable seat share in the parliament arraigned on the battlefield. **Sub-national identity politics would once again become lobbying interests with clout.**

This would mean that BJP has also to search for and win over key regional players with credible power sharing propositions. As for Congress, though the party might emerge as the largest Opposition party, structural and strategic weaknesses might reduce its strategic weight to suboptimal levels.

**_Thirdly_, the election strategies and rhetoric on both sides of the battle lines would stress poverty politics.** **Dole-outs and subsidies would return to the agenda more prominently than in the past decade**. Direct transfer of subsides and some form of universal basic income would possibly find place in election manifesto of both sides. Poverty-centric narratives would increasingly upstage social engineering and ‘divide and rule’ tactics centred around pro and anti ‘minority’ politics.

_Fourthly,_ 2024 **elections would usher in a generational shift in electoral politics.** We would see increased number of young, better educated and tech savvy candidates contesting the polls. **Legacy parties including the national parties, regional forces and even family or personality-driven entities would vie to attract and nominate younger leaders.**

Of course, between now and early 2024, we might see a huge churn in the parties. **The newer bunch of leaders would tend possibly to see party-swapping as naturally as professionals see switching employers.**

_Look at the Tamasa of leaders scrambling for cover in post-election West Bengal!_ No qualms and no life-long loyalties. At the end of all the drama, we may find qualitatively and tactically a better set of candidates lined up for the 2024 showdown.

_Fifthly_, **I expect the next elections to be the most digitally fought in India.** Apps, Virtual Reality, Bots, IVR, messaging and what not! The blitz would start early and would be aided and abetted by the visual media and overwhelmingly by social ( or not-so-social) media.

**What about the face of the ruling and opposition forces as they approach the D-Day? Who will bow the conch shells as the armies assemble for the final showdown?** It depends on whether inner part democracy prevails on both ruling and opposition sides.

In keeping with the centuries old _chaturvarnya_, we seem to follow an unwritten casteism in our political culture! Most parties have a formal or informal power centre high up there. “High Command” is someone up there, the omniscient, all-powerful person or collective whose writ shall run. **Call it by any name, but there is a command centre and the rest are followers arranged in a hierarchy of proximity to the supreme leader.**

As we approach 2024, it looks most likely that BJP might continue to project Modi as its face. _Unless he pushes for ordaining the next in line_ or the _RSS_ insists on a change of guard. Conceptually and strategically, it would be advisable if like how Modi emerged as a credible challenger in the Goa national meet of BJP before 2014 polls, another leader gathers courage and commitment to lead in 2024. It is purely for the party to decide.

As for the Opposition, it is quite unlikely that a single leader would be selected by consultative consensus to lead a united alliance_. Ambitions, one-upmanship and the temptation to wait for the relative bargaining power to emerge post the election outcome would push the parties to postpone naming the leader._ **It looks like a consensus leader for the Opposition is unlikely to emerge before the elections.**

Whether all or any of the above possibilities might come true is a matter of time. However, the preparations, alignments and soft messaging for 2024 should start sooner than later.
