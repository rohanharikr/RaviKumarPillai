The pandemic has been around for a while, long enough to shake us out of despondency. Nations and businesses are in a new learning curve of looking beyond the uncertainty of the Covid interregnum.

If the medical emergency caught the world unawares, the governance behaviour of many influential global players including nations and multilateral agencies has left much to be desired about the much-touted global resilience to shocks. When pushed to the wall, the larger collaborative objectives seemed to be giving way to base self-interest of nations and even baser instincts to score brownies points.

The US and China, the two weighty players on the global scenario demonstrated unprecedented one-upmanship during this crisis. The long-haul ahead to pull economies out of stalemate has therefore to be owned up and played deftly by governments across the globe. It is as if the titanic of global economy has hit crisis and the survivors are left to scramble for life and belongings. Now more than ever the quality of political leadership is the key differentiator between economies that survive and grow and those that would be caught in the vertex of slippage.

How does India look prepared to face the economic renewal and transformation agenda? This country has never been short of jingoism, grand standing or building castles in the air. Will the present opportunities be just another missed bus for India? Do we have it in us as a people to match-up to the focus and commitment exhibited by our smaller South East Asian neighbours when Faced with the past crisis situations?

_What is the future of all the grand talks on being the next China in the global manufacturing map?_

How would India take advantage of the post-Covid global demand to shore up our national manufacturing competence? Those of us who grumble about China having cornered the market for even mundane items like puja idols or Christmas Trees should not miss the point that _China floods markets around the globe with competitively priced goods made mostly in their rural areas engaging efficient, disciplined and affordable labour_.

Look at the representative villages in the heartland of India? Shabby surroundings, primitive infrastructure, exclusionary culture and above everything else the abysmal quality of human competence can hardly inspire the world to take India seriously as a sourcing hub for world-class products.

I am convinced that _unless the Hindi heartland undergoes a seismic shift in human capability and physical infrastructure upgrade, we can never be a serious player on the global economic arena._

China and the Far East focussed heavily on upskilling their grassroot labour for the past five decades and more, while India bothered little to educate, enable and empower the multitudes in the rural hinterland. The plight of hapless rural migrants scrambling to get back home in the wake of pandemic disturbances should make all right-thinking Indians to hang their heads in shame. As the PM made the right noises from the ramparts of the Red Fort, we need concrete follow up action and the synergy of federal competitiveness to make “a thousand flowers blossom” in the rural expanses of India. For all these 73 odd years, when did an Indian PM not make the right noises and paint rosy pictures of intentions from the Red Fort? If words were powerful resources to erase poverty, we would have by now been the top economy of the world!

_The time has come to demonstrate our seriousness to be a manufacturing hotspot the world can confidently invest in and source from._ We need to focus on building a mesh of world-class manufacturing infrastructure in the heartland states like UP, MP, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Orissa and the North East. The concerned State Governments should be facilitated and encouraged to take the lead and the Centre should provide facilitation, legal and regulatory empowerment, and streamline the global investment and supply chain linkages.

The key findings of the recently published _‘World Employment and Social Outlook Report – ILO 2020’_ are indicative of the structural malaise in employment, labour participation and upward social and economic mobility in broader global terms, but these are even more relevant to a ‘slow mover’ economy like India.

This report offers insights into the status of labour market performance around the world and presents the most recent data highlighting the labour market challenges. It offers four key messages. All the four observations have immense significance to India’s effort to make a serious attempt to put our economic recovery on course.

_First_, **projected lower economic growth and the lack of inclusiveness** are very likely to impair the ability of countries to reduce poverty and improve working conditions.

_Second_, the **under-utilization of people of working age reveals major gaps in access to work;** the rate of “total labour under-utilization” greatly exceeds that of unemployment. Idle, unproductive and disengaged employment is even more serious drag on social and economic progress than plain unemployment.

_Third_**,** even when people have jobs, there remain **significant deficiencies in work quality**. Decent work concerns the adequacy of wages or self-employment earnings, the right to job security and a safe and healthy workplace, access to social protection. **Decent work deficits are especially pronounced in the informal economy**, which registers the highest rates of in-work poverty and high shares of people who are own-account self-employed or contributing family workers.

_Fourth_**, substantial structural inequalities prevail in the access to work and work quality.** These include segmentation among workers based on a variety of factors including sex, sub-ethnicity and age.

**In the Indian context, the social stratification and exclusionary prejudices based on caste and other cultural discriminations indeed make the goal of inclusive human capital development more illusory than passionate and all-inclusive.**

If we indeed want to make India positive and progressive, we have to build the new post-Covid society driven more by social upward migration and economic empowerment. Can we build a national mission for reconstruction based on a shared vision and demonstrated commitment?

There are **five pillars of the national renewal and transformation agenda** that I envision.

_Firstly,_ **tackling unemployment, eliminating underemployment and dispersing growth to the villages** should be the most basic of our development goals.

_Secondly_, **massive education, skill development and financial empowerment of the weaker sections of society** and women should be a mission mode priority.

_Thirdly_, this nation can be transformed only by tapping the enormous **entrepreneurship and active encouragement of private investment**. We can reasonably be proud of being an enterprising society with centuries of global trade and migration history. Even today it is the private capital, investment and risk-taking that sustains our economy. India’s misfortune has been the reluctance of the ruling class to acknowledge and out-rightly encourage private investment. Covid has provided us one more opportunity to open up, encourage, regulate and be transparent about the most important lever of economic development, the tapping of the individual spirit of entrepreneurship.

_Fourthly_, digitalising the economy and governance has rightly been identified as a priority area for economy. This need to be boosted through transparent and time-bound projects. **Massive encouragement to research, start-up and global integration with the help of emerging digital technologies** lies at the core of our serious attempt to catch up with and be counted alongside the Tiger economies of the Far East.

_Finally_, we cannot be excelling in all field in today’s world of super specialization. **More than jack of all trades, the world needs specialized experts to be part of the global supply chain** eco system. Hence it makes sense for India to identify around twenty key focus areas to pivot our digital economy thrust.

As we have just finished the sobre Independence Day celebrations with the hope of a more encouraging post-vaccine regime to dawn in a few months, we have already progressed much in broadly defining the action agenda for tomorrow.

But this nation has lost out on implementation too often in the past. May this time be a different experience. Let us have just one mantra – implement, execute and engage all the citizens in nation building.

This time, the State Governments need to put their best foot forward.

_Jai Hind._
