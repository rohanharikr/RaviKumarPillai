In recent years disruption as an idea has caught the imagination and dominated development discourses globally. **Innovation and break-through ideation have come to be associated with disruptive thinking.**

_Covid 19 pandemic however flipped the idea of disruption violently._ The pandemic made the coin of disruption tails up. It is the negative connotation - uncertainty and insecurity – that is more on focus than the constructive dimension of the idea. How narratives change with alacrity when the context changes!

“The pandemic that has shuttered economies around the world has also battered education systems in developing and developed countries. [_Some 1.5 billion students_](https://www.unicef.org/press-releases/children-increased-risk-harm-online-during-global-covid-19-pandemic) _- close to 90% of all primary, secondary and tertiary learners in the world - are no longer able to physically go to school_”, wrote [Salah-Eddine Kandri](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/authors/salah-eddine-kandri), Global Head of Education, International Finance Corporation in a World Economic Forum article in May.

After 100 days from the initial lockdown in India, the situation in the country is grimmer than ever. The phased relaxation of lockdown, especially in the urban clusters, has led to varying degrees of contagion in clusters across the country. **Next to the spectre of mass reverse migration of rural workforce, the most worrisome fallout of the pandemic seems to be the unprecedented dilemma in education sector**. Higher education is at the vertex of the ongoing disruption with far reaching consequences.

Every distress and slippage is a trigger for creative evolution of alternatives that would not only obviate but enhance the business, operating and governance models.

The Draft New Educational Policy is in the public domain and discussions are active on the pros and cons of the proposals. Covid has exposed many more chinks in the armour than addressed by the draft policy which was formulated by end of 2019. **The pandemic lockdown provides a window of opportunity to revisit, review and reset the higher education framework.**

I would like to highlight **six action points of strategic importance** in crafting the post-Covid higher education ecosystem.

_Firstly,_ the immediate concern to be addressed is the **operational renewal** and realignment of higher education. The pandemic did affect the conduct of final examinations including end-of-the-course schedules. The challenge is to see how the adverse fallouts of **disruption of exam schedules** and the improvised evaluation and grading procedures can be minimised. **Admissions to the courses in the new academic year** has to be handled in transparent, fair and logical manner.

The contingent approach is inevitable in the context of the academic logjam and the issues of subjective perception and emotional impact of the outcome on the student community need to be handled with extreme sensitivity.

Going forward, it would be worthwhile to implement a system of intake in **two batches per academic year** – once in July-Aug (as at present) and an additional batch to be commenced from Dec-Jan. A regular system of dual intake would provide _more opportunities for aspiring students_ and improve operational finances of institutions. It would also obviate planning and _preparation for higher studies including overseas admissions_ by aligning the schedules better with global practices.

_Secondly**,**_ **academic content** needs to be reviewed and **aligned with the emerging demands of industry** and global academic trends. The opportunity can be used to weed out obsolete content and update the syllabus to reflect in-demand domains. The number and variety of courses should be pruned to **focus on depth, creativity and applicability rather than generalised and broad-based** programs imparting legacy knowledge.

Another area to focus would be to have **a sizeable digital component in the content.** _Digitalisation of content would enable broadening of sourcing_ and _encourage self-learning culture_ that are key to devaluing a knowledge society.

Content on **emotional and social competence modules** should become integral part of higher education. The stress should be on practice sessions to prepare students to be resilient in facing the emotional and social challenges of life and career. _Emotional education should start right from early years, even much before the higher education phase and cover upto and including professional education._

Further, **projects and internships** should be built into University education. Any higher education program after schooling should have a mandatory period of internship - ideally three to six months.

_Thirdly,_ **delivery of academic programs should be upgraded to a blended model **combining _digital and in-person delivery_. Digital technologies and innovative instructional design offer scope for flexibility, openness, collaboration and synergies.

The **higher education operating model** should ideally provide enormous scope for innovation in design, delivery, assessment and certification verticals. Institutions, researchers and scholars should have multiple options and unprecedented flexibility. The future higher education framework should be a **credit-based model with a core curriculum of essential learning and a wide variety of optional add-on credits.**

_From the current level of less than five percent of content delivery taking place online, the share of digital learning should scale up exponentially._ In a blended learning and aggregated delivery, the digital content and delivery of learning would be developed, delivered, updated and evaluated would be distributed among multiple agencies and experts even going beyond geographic and domain-specific boundaries.

To reach there, policy makers need to demonstrate willingness to move out of the legacy structures and methodologies of academics. **The crux of a proactive and strategic higher education model would be moving from teaching to learning.** The initiative for academics should shift ideally from institutions to learners, with the faculty assuming facilitating and mentoring roles. Governments and Research Institutions should make this transformation happen seamlessly.

_Fourthly_, there should be a **paradigm shift in examination, assessment and grading in the higher education** domain. Written examinations should form only a part of the assessment program and that too should be an ongoing test system rather than heavily loaded towards end of the semester exams. Ideally not more than 50% weight should be assigned to written test-based evaluation. Another 30% marks should be assigned to project work during the course. Project work would enable creative thinking, application of knowledge, social skills and problem solving. This should comprise of a series smaller projects and one final end of the course project involving external data collection and hands-on operations. The balance 20% weightage should be allotted to guided internship project.

_Fifthly_, **skill development and vocational training should be incorporated as a key component of education.** Digital skills in emerging technologies like AI, IoT, ML, AR/VR, Data Sciences should be included as options at undergraduate and post-graduate levels. **Vocational education should emerge as a serious post-schooling option and the National Vocational Competency Framework should be the basis for determining skill levels aligned to market needs.**

_Sixthly,_ **research, licencing and patenting are ideally the bedrocks of the brand equity and economic integrators of Universities**. The number of research papers published, patents obtained and technologies and innovations transferred successfully for commercial production are the strengths that catapult Higher Learning Institutions to the global roll of honour.

Though there has been in recent years some improvement in the ranking of Indian universities in global rankings, we have miles to go to catch up with US, UK, European or even with the Chinese and Far Eastern Universities. The fact that only Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore and a couple of IITs figure consistently in the global list of top academic institutions speaks volumes about the tryst with mediocrity that has come to define Indian higher education. We need to seed and curate dozens of world class institutions. Private Sector and leading Global Universities should be not only welcome but assiduously encouraged to set up shop in India.

_Finally, funding for upgrade of our higher education to world standards need massive capital investment._ There are various potential sources of funding varying from global universities, Indian corporate sector, rich and resourceful pool of alumni settled globally and multilateral agencies. Opening up higher education to private and global investment and partnerships cannot wait any further. We have been talking about it for long; time has come to act with alacrity.

We need to be spurred by the unexpected pandemic disruptions that has upset our higher education status quo; we need to change gears to a positiveness and optimism in higher education. A disrupting thinking that would lead us to shed our inhibitions and facilitate a pathbreaking journey to world class higher education.
