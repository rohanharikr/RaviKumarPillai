Kerala is among the smaller States in India. With a geographical area under 1.2 % of the country, population share of 3.5 % and GDP contribution of 4.2%, Kerala’s strategic weight in national economy lags its potential. Especially, given the high ranking the State has consistently had on social development indicators.

On Human Development, Kerala is not only at the top end of the national honours but is comparable to middle-income countries in Asia, way ahead of the rest of India. _The State leapfrogged into welfare economics riding on education, empowerment and emigrant remittances._ Successive Governments kept up the pace of social security legislations and funding for social infrastructure. What has added momentum to the earnings and lifestyle upgrade of Keralites is the consistent trend of labour migration to global markets in search of livelihood and better earnings.

But **without a productive and growing domestic economy to match the social advances, the story is one of missed opportunities and skewed policies.** Further, substantial _majority of migrants to the Gulf countries are engaged in unskilled or marginally skilled categories which are easily replaceable by local or cheaper emigrant workers._ Today, Kerala resembles a partly built house with relatively robust foundation but with an unfinished super structure.

As the ruling Left Democratic Government is embarking upon their consecutive second term, **the stage is set for some honest introspection and change of course on economic governance.**

If the State has to move up in the pecking order of national GDP ranking, **the next five years need to be focused on disruptive and long-term economic rejig.** While maintaining and building upon accomplishments in the social support programs, we need to take tough decisions for mainstreaming the backwater economy in the national and global stage.

Here is my **6 - Point Economic Agenda for building a resurgent Kerala economy.** _The new government has the mandate and wide popular support to implement an agenda quite different from the beaten track._

_Firstly,_ **the State needs to set a clear target to upgrade the positioning of Kerala in the National Economy. From 4.2%, the State needs to get to a more respectable level of 6.5% share in India’s GDP over the next five years.** That will be a tough task but not unrealistic to achieve.

Thinking outside the box and breaking free of long-held ideological baggage are the preconditions to achieve the ambitious target. Take China, Vietnam or Cuba – all of them have been able to change the way they looked at capital and attract huge investment flows.

The new government in Kerala needs to be more direct about market alignment. There is a limit to what can be achieved by reluctant half-steps when it comes to strategy and policy changes at governance level. A detailed plan has to be drawn up to improve the State GDP over the next five years.

The _second_ action point is **reforming the State Public Sector Undertakings (PSU**_). In Kerala, the public sector has remained too small, too bureaucratic and deprived of resources._

As of March 2020, Kerala had 105 Public Undertakings with a total investment of over Rs. 63,000 Crores. More than half the investment was locked up in just three Utilities – KSEB (Electricity), KSRTC (public transport) and KWA (Water Supply).

**The other half of the State’s PSU investments are fragmented and spread across a variety of units, with none of them having the capacity or revenue to be counted among the top five in the respective industry nationally.**

I would strongly recommend a three-pronged approach to revitalise the public sector investments in Kerala. Time has come to right-size the units, outsource select non-core functions and enhance technical and managerial competence in the retained units. Strategic decision on retaining, hiving off or closing down units need to be taken after thorough analysis. PSEs need to be benchmarked with the national best-in class-units.

1\. **Upgrade, professionalise and improve customer orientation of the Public Utility Units.** Align them with the National Policy framework to derive funding and technical support from federal government. While some states have progressed much on public sector reforms, Kerala has so far hesitated.

Look at Electricity reforms. **While most States have trifurcated generation, transmission and distribution in line with National legislation, Kerala has chosen the politically expedient path of simply corporatizing the composite entity.** Further Kerala has not been welcoming of private investment in larger power projects.

2\. **Reform the ten most strategic PSUs and curate them to be counted among the top five in the respective industries nationally.** Use joint-ventures, alliances and partnerships with domestic and global business to restructure. Companies like Kerala Metals and Minerals Limited (KMML), Travancore Cochin Chemicals(TCC) and KEL (Kerala Electrical & Allied Industries Limited) could be candidates for restructuring and renewal agenda. Once restructured, these core PSUs should be listed on the national bourses and over a time the State should become minor partner with 26-49 percent shareholding. Strategic partners should be brought in to help the unit to grow. There should be no ideological untouchability with the concept of privatisation.

3\. **Exit the bulk of PSU pygmies - smaller, unviable and fund guzzlers.** They should be reviewed and marked for appropriate exit. The assets could be monetised and employees paid off final settlement. (Look at Kerala Automobiles or United Electrical Industries Limited- they can never be viable to compete and win order against the larger players nationally).

_Thirdly,_ Kerala needs to **increase the share of State in manufacturing nationally.** We can **focus on digital technologies hardware, electrical industry including EV and Solar technology components and pharmaceuticals**. The initiatives taken so far are good but they are more in the nature of token and tiny steps.

Kerala must pivot manufacturing projects around the proposed Bangalore-Coimbatore-Kochi Industrial corridor.

Three initiatives are required from the State Government:

· **Create a land bank and use innovative methods** including land pooling and leasing to find the space needed. Identify and utilise idle land with the dead or comatose industrial units, which we have aplenty scattered around.

· **Realign vocational training, skill development and continuous learning** especially in emerging digital technologies. Kerala has already created a well acclaimed **start-up ecosystem and digital technology learning framework** to build upon.

· **Make serious and visible efforts to enhance ease of business.** Create a business-friendly bureaucratic environment and disciplined and competitive labour relations and work culture_. (This can only be done by a left government and we need to cover more ground than just superficial statement of intentions.)_

_Fourthly,_ **tourism – including medical and ayurvedic tourism- needs to be given a boost.** We need to be mindful of factors that make Srilanka and Maldives more preferred destinations than _God’s Own Country._ Trivandrum Airport should be developed into an integrated global transit hub with the investment and marketing prowess of the licensee, Adani Group.

**Ideologies cannot create jobs and income for people; pragmatism can.** Privatising KTDC assets and shifting the focus of the corporation to promoting private and joint tourism investment is an urgent priority.

_Fifthly,_ **Kerala needs to fast track infrastructure development especially on mobility.** _Roads, rail connectivity and multimodal urban transport_ need to be developed on mission mode. The proposed semi-speed rail, highways upgrade and integrated transport network utilising water transport opportunity would need to be pushed intensively for early completion.

**The Special Purpose Vehicle (KIIFB) needs to be strengthened, fine-tuned and effectively leveraged.** It is a well-established model of project funding globally and there is no need to follow an ostrich like approach on the concept.

_Lastly,_ **Kerala needs to build on the public education accomplishments. Vocational education needs to be mainstreamed.** _Skills development program has to be aligned to the emerging requirements in India and our traditional job markets like the Gulf._

Overseas workforce is a vital part of Kerala’s economy and would remain so. Hence it would be smart and proactive for us to look for emerging opportunities and prepare our workforce.

**It is time for Kerala to have a high-level task force to work in coordination with the Indian missions overseas to identify and develop newer overseas markets for our skill-ready workforce.**

I do hope the new government would pursue these and other strategic areas for action and fulfilment over the next five years. Kerala can and should become an economic heavy weight apart from being high up on social indicators.
