The unease created by the interventionist Administrator of Lakshadweep is cause of concern for right thinking citizens.  
  
There is an existential dilemma faced by traditional and secluded societies in outlying areas of vast and expansive countries. The same is true of USA, Canada, Australia, China and India.  
  
These local communities are too sensitive about intrusions by outsiders keen to 'modernise' them. In India, the diversity of our population offers many instances of such sub-regional nationalism.  
  
The isolation and sense of insecurity of communities in Santhal tribal areas, Chambal forests, Wayanad's hilly habitats, islanders in Andamans and Lakshadweep archipelagos are tests of the larger India's sense of accommodation, empathy, care and concern.  
  
Trampling on the customs, living styles and belief systems of these spread-out pockets of civilisations would be counterproductive and would destroy the rich cultural heritage of this vast, pluralistic nation.  
  
There is no alternative to pluralistic sensitivities to govern this large and diverse land of ours.
