##### **Economy Nuggets:** 

### **Highlighting Five Topical Themes for the Week, July 13-20**

**Focus 1: Government of India wants the value of domestic electronic hardware production to jump nearly six-fold in five years — from $70 billion in FY19 to $400 billion in 2025.** 

To achieve this objective, it is banking on one segment — mobile devices. The plan is to transform India into the world’s biggest export hub for mobiles after China and overtaking Vietnam (which together with China controls 80 per cent of the global export market). This will require mobile manufacturers in India to increase their production value seven-fold from current levels and export more than half of what we produce in value. At present, domestic manufacturers account for just 5 per cent of the global mobile production value. Government wants India to have a third of the global market share by 2025.

**Focus 2: India is burdened by Public Debt**

In India, the combined outstanding debt of the Union and State governments is estimated to be \~147 trillion at the end of March 2020, a level that is about **three-fourths of its gross domestic product (GDP).** States account for three fourth of this debt burden. Not surprisingly Maharashtra, Gujarat and Karnataka have relatively better shape of State debt situation. It shows how economic activities rather than political jingoism of provincial leaders would make a regional economy healthy. Boost local economic activity and curate private sector ecosystem. That is the only mantra for pulling the teeming millions out of poverty.

**Focus 3: The Twin Lock-down Worries of people globally**

The corona virus pandemic is throwing the world into financial insecurity, posing a threat to the recession-hit global economy. Consumers keep saving rather than spending. A new YouGov survey across 26 countries shows consumers everywhere are concerned about their jobs and household budgets. They’re also cautious about spending or investing the money they do have.

**Focus 4: Joe Biden’s Economics has a political undertone**

Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee for president, put forth a moderate plan for the economy that aligned with his new campaign slogan, “Build Back Better.” With the goal of creating five million additional American jobs, he proposed incentives to “Buy American,” spur domestic innovation and reduce dependency on foreign manufacturing. Progressive Democrats were disappointed with his ideas, which don’t sound all that different from Mr. Trump’s. Many Americans approve of Mr. Trump’s handling of the economy, even if they don’t otherwise like him.

_Note: Talking politics more than economics makes sense in the World’s most powerful democracy as much as in the World’s largest democracy._

**Focus 5: Dealing with (and learning from failures)**

People tend to ignore failure when it’s safe to do so. By contrast, when the stakes in the failures are so large that they cannot be safely ignored, people do tune in and learn. There’s a phenomenon in psychology called **_aversion learning_**_._ For example, lab rats who taste poison, receive shocks, or experience other painful “failures” learn from the experiences. _There is a threshold above which we learn from failure, but many everyday failures don’t pass muster._

Where is that threshold? It depends. It’s somewhere between getting a multiple-choice question wrong and tasting poison.

Note: The threshold depends on the nature and impact of the failure and the emotional resilience and positivism of the individuals. To find the threshold and to proactively build preparedness and resilience is a challenge each of us has to seriously approach.
