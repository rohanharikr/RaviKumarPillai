Indian Stock Market recovered from the lows of March 2020 to touch record highs even as the economy faced unprecedented disruptions – widespread lockdown, slump in business and jobs, operational uncertainties, bankruptcies and mounting debt. It may sound ironic that despite the gloom and uncertainties around, the benchmark NIFTY Index of National Stock Exchange zoomed past 14500 and the counterpart BSE Sensex (of Bombay Stock Exchange) has gone past 49,000 . Sensex would ascend Mount 50 K possibly around Budget time.

_Amidst the fireworks in the bourses and celebrations by Foreign Portfolio Investors and High Networth Individuals, most Indians have remained silent spectators on the side-lines. With a retail participation rate below 2% of the population at around 20 Million individual investors, substantial majority of Indians avoid investing their money in equity markets._

True, over the past few months, possibly due to slackness in professional and business activities in the wake of lockdown, many young and first-time investors have ventured into online equity trading. Number of fresh dmat accounts opened has significantly increased. Yet the number of sceptics continue to be high. **What is it that hinders even sections of population with affordability and the advantages of age and saving potential from taking to equity investment?**

_Typically, the population can be roughly divided into three broad slices on the propensity for equity investment._

A **small segment of natural investors** forming around 2-5 percent with high net-worth, traditional business orientation and risk resilience takes to investing like duck to water.

At the other end of the spectrum, typically around 25-30 percent of people struggle for day-to-day survival. This group has neither deployable savings nor risk-taking ability to take up equity investment. This segment of people at the borderline sustenance level could be as high as 50 percent of the population in the aftermath of the lockdown economic pressures.

Then there is **the bulky middle segment** which comprises mainly of professionals, first generation employees, small and medium entrepreneurs and gig workers. _Mostly young, educated, digitally enabled and ambitious, these are usually the trend setters and influencers in a market economy._

In terms of equity investment behaviours, this critical middle segment is the most natural group with potential to migrate to the retail equity investor category. If retail participation in equity has to improve this segment has to gain competence and confidence to engage actively in capital market activities. By being on the side-lines, this potential group of prospective investors do miss out on the opportunities to take advantage of the action in the bourse. Afterall, it isn’t rocket science to make money in the stock market!

_Equity investment like any other financial decision-making is a trade-off between risks and rewards. How you perceive, assess and leverage these two factors to generate returns is essentially a behavioural process._ You can train yourself to be good at that just like you could pick up driving or swimming skills by practice.

**Successful equity market investment is a function of Awareness, Analysis and Behaviours.** I would suggest the skill-mix for sustainable equity investment would be essentially three factors - _knowledge of economy and business, data analysis and interpretation skills and emotional and behavioural resilience._

It is important to be an informed investor. **Awareness** is the foundation for equity investment competence and would cover a wide range of economic, industry and corporate knowledge. One has to know the broader macro-economic realities, trends and the likely opportunities and challenges. Equally important is the awareness about legal, tax and procedural framework.

While one can always depend on advisers and brokerages for guidance, I believe it is important to do extensive self-study and be prepared to take cautious, calm and step-by-step approach to investment. Making a habit of reading a financial newspaper would help you to stay upto-date on current and emerging business and economic trends. Plenty of resources are available over the internet and media channels on business finance and economic trends. However, one should be wary of prescriptive guidance since motivated opinions can lead you to blind alleys.

This brings us to the second success factor for equity investment- Analysis. A basic knowledge of **financial and technical analysis** would boost your ability to identify opportunities to spot potential stock picks for upside.

_Financial analysis_ looks at key financial performance indicators of the company such as Profit and Loss Account and Balance Sheet of Companies. This would help to broadly assess the financial health of the underlying business. Basic skills to read and interpret financial statements can be acquired without much technicalities.

_While financial analysis helps you to understand the intrinsic value and growth trend of the business, technical analysis_ deals with analysing and interpreting the stock price movement in the market.

Observing the stock price movements during the day, week, month, quarter and year could give insight into investor perceptions and confidence in the potential value of the share. When we buy shares of a company, the price we pay reflect the current perceived value of the future earnings potential of the business.

Ability to interpret chart patterns would be helpful in identifying and aligning with market movement. Fundamentally business performance, the uniqueness and market potential of the product and services portfolio of the company and the quality of its management are the key determinants for you to zero in on likely ‘winner’ stocks. I would say technical analysis is secondary to fundamental financial strength of the company.

Without going much into technicalities of chart patterns, the Price to Earning (P/E) ratio of the stock over time as well as against peer group would help in making trading and investment decisions. With all these inputs, one can get an approximate 360-degree perspective of the scrip. But any analysis is relevant at the time of making the assessment since any of the external or internal factors impacting the performance of the company would possibly change over time. Hence the need for continuous review and monitoring of your portfolio.

Stock Market often witnesses manipulative moves by companies and investors trying to create uptrends or downslides to gain from such moves. Everyone doesn’t play by the rule. **Hence going by price movements without due weight on business fundamentals can mislead you into investing in the wrong stocks.**

Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has over the years brought in many regulatory guidelines and procedural upgrades for enhancing transparency and accountability and punishing malafide operators. There is still need for caution. It is your money and you need to be alert and alive to ground situations.

The _third_ and most important competence for successful investment is your **emotional resilience**_. Patience, consistency, alertness and self-belief_ are key behavioural traits for being an equity investor.

Let me close on a personal note. I took to investment in equity around two decades back. Based on my experience I would suggest **five golden rules for those who are interested but hesitant to take the plunge.**

_Firstly_, _it is never late to start._ The equity market in India has been attracting massive global and domestic investor interest. The depth and breadth of our market are expanding. _Better late than never, make an entry and take baby steps to find your moorings._

_Secondly, consistency, continuity and confidence would help you to build your portfolio over time._ There will surely be ups and downs. A slow and systematic investor can grow his portfolio irrespective of market swings. It is important to have the mindset of a marathon runner and not a sprinter.

_Thirdly, never make the mistake of borrowing to invest in equity market._ If you want sustainable equity investment, do deploy only that part of your savings that you can park for a medium to long term comfortably. As a thumb rule, it is wise not to exceed 20% of your disposable savings in equity investment.

_Fourthly, I suggest that you follow a two-basket strategy for equity investment._ Identify a core portfolio of handful of stocks for value investment where you perceive potential for medium to long term growth. You should research and identify a select few businesses and corporates that you are passionately convinced about long term prospects. You can have a _second bucket for pure- play trading_ where you can look at making short term money.

_Finally, train your mind to be objective, resilient and willing to handle setbacks_ and challenges dispassionately. Most people burn their fingers in the bourse because they allow themselves to be driven by what Allen Greenspan called “irrational exuberance”. To know when to exit and when to stay quiet are as much important as going long on stocks. Emotional Intelligence is perhaps the most important competency for being a sustainable investor.
