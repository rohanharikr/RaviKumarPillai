C-Suit discussions in India tend to be focussed more on operational items with less of proactive brainstorming on potential opportunities and strategic risks ahead, except in a few corporates with robust management culture and visionary leadership.

Even when Boards discuss strategy, the time spent on compensation structure, challenges and strategies is usually far less compared to market, financing and technology/product issues. The availability of options for leveraging executive and employee payments for competitive advantage is relatively less recognized by most corporate leaderships.

_Payment of wages, salaries and operating incentives are treated as routine – or at best as tactical issue in times of crisis- rather than as strategic priorities._

The picture is changing fast now as more and more organizations are waking up to the opportunities for optimising operating cost, enhancing employee engagement and retaining key talent.

The size and impact of salary related expenses are too big to be ignored from strategic canvas any more. _Salaries and wages accounted for over 30 per cent of factory Gross Value-Add (GVA) in FY 2018-19_**,** according to the Annual Survey of Industries (ASI) released by the National Statistical Office. In knowledge industry and other sunrise sectors where critical talent commands premium valuation, rewards expenses are significantly higher than in the legacy sectors.

**Deloitte Report on ‘2021 Global Human Capital Trends’**, indicates that _compensation is the largest component of an organization’s costs_, accounting for _as much as 70 percent of total operating costs in some cases_.

The context is appropriate for upping the strategic focus on salary elements with the imminent roll out of the new National Wage Code from April 1, 2021.

The new wage code stipulates that basic salary shall be at least 50% of the Cost-to-Company (CTC) remuneration package. This is a major change.

_Most private employers have been paying relatively lower basic salary for routine jobs for operational reasons including to keep the derived benefits and incidentals pay-out within limits._

**The implication of this provision is that the CTC would undergo a rejig in most cases.** While reducing the existing basic salary component would be too disruptive and lead to widespread dissatisfaction among employees, employers would have to take a hit as a fall out of revising the non-basic component to match the fixed (basic salary) half of the package.

**However, the situation provides an opportunity to review, simplify and rationalise the allowances and benefits components, aligning with the statutory guidelines as well as tax provisions.**

_The opportunity can be used to design and dovetail incentives, performance pay and skill-upgrade support_ in the overall package so as to make the total package a strategic tool to recognize and reward talent and outcomes generated.

I would recommend that the strategi troika of **performance-pay, skill-development recognition and key-talent retention** should be incorporated in the new compensation structure through well-crafted rewards programs.

On the **social security provisions** such as provident fund and gratuity as well as coverage of employee state insurance (ESI) based medical expenses support, the new code brings in flexibility and enhancement which would go a long way in enabling skill-mobility and end-of-service payments. These provisions would **facilitate ease-of-employment, job changes and exits, all of which have been stifled by the archaic and bureaucratic labour laws and procedures** which had a “big brother” role for the government in matters of employment contract, termination and payment of salaries and wages.

Another long pending reform that is part of the new labour code is the **recognition of alternative modes of employment** such as limited term contracts, outsourced workforce and contract workers. By bringing in transparency and formalisation into the employment framework, the national pool of workforce would gain recognition, security and flexibility.

It is time for us to view employment as a talent-based contract of engagement between employers and workforce which recognizes the freedom and flexibility for both parties to align with changing market conditions while ensuring a robust social security net for workers to support their quest to retain and enlarge employability and skill upgrade.

From now on, **companies and executive leaderships should recognize and strategize employee payment as a key element in the long-term health and prosperity of organizations.**

In fact, _time is ripe even for Governments and the public sector to be proactive on talent management and rewards strategies._

**Lack of outcome-based recognition and rewards programs has been a bane of public sector in most developing nations.** The return on capital employed in the state-run enterprises has been abysmally low and this has been a major reason for inadequate capital formation in the public domain. Borrowing to meet the payroll expenses and stalling the much-needed investments for system and infrastructure upgrade have proved to be counterproductive in enabling nations to break out of the culture of lethargy and mediocrity.

**At the macro level we need to have a compensation policy that pays the socially strategic roles adequately so as to attract people of integrity, talent and commitment to these positions.** A policeman, school teacher, paramedic, or frontline public servant needs to be paid well and held accountable to generate outcomes that are measurable and challenging.

Such a performance-oriented culture in Government and Public Sector would correct the existing skewness in accountability and rewards management between public sector and private sector. A rationale-based relativity between public and private employment is a must for elevating the entire economy to global standard and to attract talent to both public and private sector with objectivity.

Ultimately, _people should have a choice to opt for a career in any of the sectors and should have the flexibility and opportunity to make career shifts laterally or vertically at any stage._

That is the sign of a sustainable learning society. That is my dream for India. In realising that dream a national policy on compensation and rewards strategies play a key role.
