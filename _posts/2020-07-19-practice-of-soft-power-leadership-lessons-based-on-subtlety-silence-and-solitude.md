There are boisterous leaders and there are subdued leaders. Contemporary global political scenario seems to be driven by strong leaders at the helm across nations. Vladimir Putin, Xi Jingping, Shinzo Abe, Recep Erdogan, Rodrigo Duterte and Narendra Modi figure in the breed of aggressive leaders. Not surprisingly, many of them demonstrate streaks of authoritarian and narcissist overbearing.

On the other side of the coin, there are leaders with predominantly soft and subtle styles. There is a discernible understatement in their styles and behaviors. History is replete with examples of soft power - Abraham Lincoln, Barrack Obama, Mother Teresa, Dalai Lama and Mahatma Gandhi are counted among all-time greats of this genre of leadership in different domains.

In the national context of India, at least two former Prime Ministers stand out for their understated leadership styles - PV Narasimha Rao and Dr. Manmohan Singh. As for Business, Ratan Tata, Azim Premji and Narayan Murthy apart from the legendary JRD Tata exemplify the rare breed of corporate leaders with innate simplicity, moderation and refinement. _None of them displayed high-decibel power leadership behavior._ Yet the loyalty that their personal brands command from those associated with their organizations as stakeholders (in some cases long after they relinquished formal roles of authority) is remarkable.

In diverse fields, soft leadership style is being increasingly recognized as transformational. Leadership behavior is influenced by a range of factors such as demographics, culture, formalization and stability of political environment and regulatory effectiveness. We are living in an age of power-hyphenated diplomacy, business, and politics. The ‘power-push’ strategy is influenced by Western ethos and practices. **Display of hard power behavior has come to be accepted as ‘normal’ management practice over the years.**

How a society perceives power dynamics is defined by its cultural moorings. Aggressive business and diplomatic practices have yielded significant influence, wealth and strategic dominance for the Western economies. However, governments, institutions and corporates in Japan and the Far East with their Oriental values and culture did succeed alongside the hard-power western model businesses. Empathy, accommodation and an innate gentleness have been the defining traits of their leadership and governance styles.

Leadership success stories from across multiple domains and geographies show that **high visibility power push is neither requisite nor preferable for successful leadership**.

Pursuit of goals with a human touch is now more relevant than ever before even as humanity is perched on the threshold of post-Covid economics. **Composition of workforce, work practices and strategic priorities are expected to be significantly impacted in the emerging business and economic scenario.**

With heightened risk perception and pressure on resource optimization, survival and continuity are at stake for businesses and people. _The time for soft leadership has arrived._ We need to rediscover the innate power of calm, restrained and clearheaded approach to address the emerging challenges.

We are on the threshold of a new phase of management and leadership style. The bruised emotional climate of the post-Covid recovery phase as well as the likely emergence of more digitized operations would hasten the switch from hard to soft leadership style.

‘Understatement’ is a characteristic behavior of  soft leaders. It quite simply means the _intentional use of weak or subtle narratives to communicate stronger propositions._ The intent is clear and focused; but the expression and style are deliberately pitched low-key. Understatement as a strategy works well in pushing changes which would normally be resisted if pursued too hard. Hard-selling creates an emotional distance between the stakeholders and impedes collaboration.

This brings us to the three  S’s of soft power - **subtlety , silence and solitude.**

**Subtlety** means **being deliberately low key in presenting one’s view point**. A subtle leader creates space for others to express, argue and defend ideas. Listening is the key attribute of subtle leadership. Display of impatience to bring the other party over to our view point can create fissures in the credibility of our position.

After all, rigidity breaks consensus building while elasticity sustains relationships and dialogues. Subtle and patient approach has a higher probability of success than obstinate pursuit of agreement. But the challenge is to know our goals, show clarity of processes and benchmarks and pursue the outcome with calm and commitment.

Soft approach, to succeed, would need the enabling behavioral anchoring on **_Tenor, Tenacity and Timing._**

_Tenor_ is the train of thought and messaging pattern. A soft leader would use sober, comforting and relaxed tone, content and logic to convey the message. **It requires practice and conviction to adopt a natural tenor devoid of a shade of intimidation.**

_Tenacity_ is the persistence to never give up and never stop trying. You can be tenacious without offending the other party only if you have genuine conviction of your stance and you practice subtle and soft style in putting across a differing perception or proposal.

_Timing_ is equally important. When you say is as important as what and how you say. Timing and spacing of the message allow the other person opportunity to take in the message and be prepared with objective response. Bulldozing our way is not a healthy and sustainable negotiation strategy. Allowing time would signal openness, care and concern to the views and interests of the other party.

**Silence**, the second of the Triad of “S’s is both an element and a strategy in soft power. The acclaimed Chinese philosopher, **Lao Tzu**th  (6th Century, BC)   said, _“Silence is a source of great strength.”_

What is silence? Many people would say “loneliness”; some would say, “blankness” and yet others might say, “ inactivity”. Many of us take communication in a narrow sense as the ability to speak out or convey a message to others. **It is an irony that the most critical and powerful element of communication is often taken for granted – _the ability to listen intensely_.** How you listen conveys a lot of subtle messages about your openness, compassion and accommodation of differing viewpoints.

**Silence offers you the opportunity to objectively and intensely listen** without inhibitions. Silence de-clutters your mind. It creates a healthier connect with others. _Silence is not easy, because it requires emotional regulation to let go of your ego, biases, prejudices_ and the urge to score brownie points. Positive silence can be a source of comfort and support; **compassionate listening is the best gift that you can offer to others**, especially to one in emotional distress. Practice of positive silence is critical to soft leadership.

**Solitude, a deeper and intensely personal variant of silence,  is opportunity for quality time with your own self.** Solitude provides scope to practice self-compassion and to indulge in meaningful self-talk. It is akin to refueling your emotional wellness. Solitude improves your focus, productivity and creativity. Neuroscience highlights the nourishing effects of silence and solitude on brain health. Silence and solitude are known to enhance creativity and memory.

Commitment to and practice of soft power are worth investing time and effort. It is a key component of self-renewal strategy. 

_An Exercise for Practice_

Think of a recent experience when you had to negotiate with an individual or team to convince them on a proposal. Note down the issue involved, the process of negotiation followed and a summary of the outcome achieved. Now revisit the experience and write down _how you would have used soft power in negotiation and how the outcome could have been enhanced._ Go through the case and if comfortable discuss with your team. Self development comes through practice, feedback and introspection.
