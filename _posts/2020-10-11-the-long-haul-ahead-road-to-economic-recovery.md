World is waiting with baited breath for the vaccines to arrive. Economies, big and small, are experiencing the stresses and strains of the pandemic fallout on all walks of life. Discussions and debates abound on the possible recovery trajectory of growth. It is beyond doubt that the onslaught of the virus has shaved off the growth momentum across the board. Everyone from the developed world to the least developed nations have been impacted by the unexpected viral attack.

World Bank has just published its biennial World Poverty Report. Each edition of the Report is looked forward to by economists and policy makers as a periodic reality check on the global poverty landscape. The 2020 Report titled _Poverty and Shared Prosperity 2020: Reversals of Fortune_ provides a rich collection of data and detailed analysis of the causes and consequences of the indisputable reversal in global poverty reduction accomplishments due to Covid, among other reasons.

**Findings of the report show that pandemic-related job losses and deprivation worldwide are hitting the already-poor and vulnerable sections harder than others.** Further the disruptions have added a new category of “poor” - mostly urban, better educated and comprising of displaced employees, gig workers and self-employed. It is ironic that even as we have been used to talking about the additions to the neo-rich sections of the populace, we are now confronted with a significant group of neo-poor!

_COVID-19 is expected to push an additional 100 million people into extreme poverty during 2020 alone. In addition, the slide into lower affordability levels affects a large chunk of the middle class._ The effects of the current crisis will almost certainly be felt in most countries through 2030.

The going was getting tougher for world economy even before Covid. Global economic slowdown, increase in sectarian militancy in various parts and the fallout of climate change on ecology and food safety have been building up dark clouds in the global economic growth story. The world-scale pandemic could not have come at a worse time.

According to World Bank Report, though extreme poverty was consistently dropping by an average of about 1 percentage point per year over the quarter century from 1990 to 2013, the rate of reduction slowed during 2013 to 2015 to just 0.6 percentage point and further to half a percentage point thereafter in the subsequent 3 years. In South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa, millions of people had only narrowly escaped extreme poverty before COVID-19. _Those who have just escaped extreme poverty can easily fall back; they are especially vulnerable to the impoverishing effects of the pandemic._

**India’s aspirations to become a 5 Trillion Dollar Economy would need to be tempered against the new reality of rural distress, job losses and slump in public spending.** We have to recast our goals and renew our commitments within the contours of the global macroeconomic headwinds.

The Poverty Report forecasts for 2019–21 indicate that most economies will continue to see substantially lower shared prosperity across this period. _Shared prosperity as a concept is a measure of the convergence of the per capita GDP growth among the bottom 40% of the population to the mean national growth rate._ It captures the income, living standards and human capital disparities in the population.

According to the WB Report, rural population, women and children below 14 years are most likely to be significantly affected by the economic slump. The resources and emotional resilience to crawl back to near normalcy during the post Covid phase would be tested more severely in the case of this section rather than the overall population.

World Bank considers Sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia and Middle East to be the more vulnerable geographies to the recovery pangs.

India is in a none-too-envious position in this do-or-die stage of re-growth. **The most critical agenda for India and most other developing nations would be _ensuring food security, liquidity and employment for the bottom 40% of the population and increasing the public spending for physical and social infrastructure._**

The challenge is however to find the funds for the same. The World is staring at massive debt burden even as pressure would mount on Governments to address the potential growth triggers and strategies. Even before growth, the emergency requirements for pandemic responses including the potential vaccine related logistics and immunization drive as well as the need for beefing up social security would demand more public spending. **The capacity of many developing nations including India to boost investment and public spending to the required threshold for sustainable recovery is indeed quite limited.**

In this context, the Government has little option but to risk overstepping fiscal prudence and monetary tightness with a moderated pragmatism. The economy and society at large need to learn to live with precarious inflationary pressures in the short term. On its part, **Government has to attract and fast-track the productive global and domestic private capital for infrastructure spending.** With structural reforms slowly inching their way and a more favourable global disposition towards India as destination for investment, the Government has to show urgency in execution.

There would be a recovery for sure. Growth would return. **But whether it would take a V,U or W shape would depend on the behaviour of the virus, global cooperation in concerted response to pandemic, agility and focus on the part of National Government and the Corporate Sector responses to the business challenges and opportunities.**

_All indications do point to a long haul ahead for the world to get back to the pre-Covid growth rate._ For India, next three years are indeed critical to act with vision, drive and commitment to bring in inclusive growth. In the meanwhile, let us not harbour illusions of quick-fix solutions to the pandemic scars.
