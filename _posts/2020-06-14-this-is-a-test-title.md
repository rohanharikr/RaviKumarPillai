As the Supreme Court of India took up the contentious issue of Adjusted Gross Revenue (AGR) and computation of arrears payable by the Telecom Operators on last Thursday, the flip-flop and tentative nature of our bureaucratic governance was exposed for the umpteenth time.

The bench headed by Justice Arun Mishra raised questions on the demand raised on the PSUs and said that its verdict in the case was misinterpreted. Including non-Telecom PSUs in utility sectors like Oil and Gas and Power in the demand for AGR-based revenue-sharing for telecom license fees was extraneous and unwarranted according to the Court. The contentions of the Private operators related to the huge demand raised by DoT for dues on account of pending licence fee and interest for delays.

_The Telecom scenario in India as it has panned out since liberalization needs a serious and critical look at this juncture._

At this time, when the nation is reeling from the fall out of pandemic lock-down and mass reverse migration, telecom has become the life line for regaining a semblance of normalcy. **The Telecom infrastructure has proved to be a silver lining in the current scenario of economic and emotional distress.** With gaps in resources and operations, the Telecom sector has struggled hard in the wake of the pandemic.

Imagine what would have been the scene if a situation like this had arisen a couple of decades back. The strain would have been several notches more severe than what we are just going through. What prevented the lock-down from becoming a choke-down of the economy was the capacity and resilience of telecom service providers in spite of constraints.

Both connectivity and capacity were issues that the industry was already struggling with. But the surge in data traffic due to lock-down exceeded all expectations. The unprecedented uptick was a combined effect of **massive shift from office to Work-From-Home (WFM) protocol, higher frequency of virtual meetings, increased video-streaming and steep climb in gaming activities.** Academic and governance uses also added significantly to the pressure on the networks.

_In the past three months alone, the data and video traffic increased by approximately 50% year-on-year._ It is to the credit of the beleaguered Telcos that they rose to the challenge and by and large provided quality and efficient service.

As an infrastructure sector baptized in fire, Indian Telecom was struggling to drag itself through bureaucratic rigmarole as well as severe funding and execution woes over the past couple of decades. Every stage from issue of licenses and release of spectrum to going through consolidation was plagued by opacity and tentativeness on policy and procedures. “Left to fend for itself” could aptly summarize the plight of the sector.

The weak-kneed operators folded up and some opted for merger with the more resilient players. The consolidation of multiple players to a handful was always on the cards. In fact, weeding out unviable players is a healthy growth path for telecom in nascent markets. **However, the pain and rigors of regulatory and legal vacillations made a tall demand on the endurance capacity of the surviving players.** The tenacity, commitment and perseverance of the private players still in the reckoning need to be appreciated. The newest kid on the block, Reliance Jio, charted out a growth path through sheer hard work and deep pockets. In the process Jio not only shook the sector into urgency and proactivity but also built for India a robust fibre network that would probably have taken decades for the Government sector.

**India’s economic management history is replete with a strange death wish** **that raises its head from time to time and puts a spoke in the organic growth of business.** The dilemma of our low global competitiveness stems from structural flaws - a _bureaucracy_ which by tradition and training _acts more like cynical controllers rather than collaborative executives_, rigid and constraining set of _laws, often not aligned to the economic realities_, _judiciary mired in delays_ and a _myopic political leadership_ hesitant to take the unbeaten path.

Telecom is the lifeline of a digital economy. It is as much essential for survival, sustenance and growth of society as are the basic necessities like shelter, air, water, power and transportation. The 5-G revolution is knocking at our door. If we miss the bus, the digital divide would exasperate and we would lose out the chance to catch up with the developed world on key economic and human development indicators. Scaling up of the connectivity, capacity and security of telecom networks is critical for upgrading our infrastructure including education, healthcare, governance, industry and logistics.

With the consolidation of the sector, we are left with three major Telecom players - Reliance Jio, Bharti Airtel and Vodafone-Idea. As for the Public Sector player, BSNL, it is unlikely to emerge as a serious and strategic player. It is more likely to remain a laggard; in the best-case scenario it might perhaps evolve into a core network and infrastructure provider offering connectivity, storage and support facilities for the industry. With vast assets in terms of land, Right-of-Way and physical structures, BSNL can leverage and monetize them to gain steady cash flow.

**Going forward we would see explosive growth of data, video, storage, security and functional platforms and applications.** There would be need to invest heavily, build state-of-the-art infrastructure and massively train and upskill talent. We need to encourage pathbreaking innovation and research into sunrise domains of digital technology. We need to build synergistic partnerships of domestic and global manufacturers, service providers, investors and professionals.

Are we preparing the ground to attract the best in the world to come to India and invest with confidence? Are we assuring policy consistency, responsive governmental support and availability of competent local partners, professionals and workforce?

Let us run through the track record of liberalizing telecom sector in India, starting with licensing of a limited number of private operators in metro cities in 1992. The first pan-India licensing was carried out three years later, when 22 circles across India were opened up for private investment. The license fee was required to be paid in seven annual payments progressively increasing over the period to allow for funding ease.

The nascent operators had to set up the infrastructure from scratch and had to go through enormous teething troubles and financing issues. In 1999, realizing the gravity of the burden on the operators, Government allowed the operators to switch to a revenue-sharing model instead of the huge fixed license fee. As per the new policy, 15 per cent of Adjusted Gross Revenue (AGR) was to be paid as licence fee. This was later progressively reduced based on pleas by operators to 8 percent.

**The method of calculating the AGR was disputed by the licensees; they approached the Court seeking to limit the calculation of AGR to the income from telecom service provision only.** They contended that the license related only to telecom operations and therefore it was not justified to include income from investments, sale of assets and the like in the calculation of AGR. They lost the case. After a series of appeals and counter pleas, the issue has lingered on for nearly seventeen years. The matter is now before the Supreme Court. The present plea of operators, supported by the Government after so much dilly-dallying, is for relief by way of staggering, over the next 20 year, the payment of pending dues of license fees and accumulated interest. This piquant situation should not have arisen in the first place. **The strain, delay and erosion of business confidence could have been avoided, if only the policies were drafted with realistic appreciation of the business challenges and investment risks.**

Today, we are at a critical juncture requiring massive investment and speedy project execution to scale up telecom infrastructure. The much needed physical, economic and social infrastructure upgrade depends on seamless 5G capabilities.

**The questions that Supreme Court has asked are core to the transparency and rationale of sound governance**. It is primary responsibility of the Government to frame, administer and attune the laws, guidelines and procedures in a manner that convinces legal scrutiny or audit. The outcome of the current case has enormous bearing on the viability, sustainability and prospects of Telecom in the country.

If the Court agrees to the staggered payment, Department of Technology (DoT) should ensure fast and flawless follow-up. In the event of Court not agreeing to the deferment, Government should have an alternative strategy to provide relief and support to the sector.
