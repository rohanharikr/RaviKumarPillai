This year India celebrates a subdued Republic Day with scaled down pageantry and shortened marching route along the Rajpath. A fallout of pandemic induced restraint.

Of late, a lot of talk and tangential debates have been circulating on the concepts of Nationalism and Patriotism. As the Republic turns seventy-one, it is appropriate to look dispassionately at the narratives around these ideas. The fledgling Republic set sail in 1950 on the experiment of representative governance on a scale never before witnessed by the world. Many doubts and apprehensions were raised on the efficacy of democratic governance in a grossly illiterate and economically deprived society which was fragmented by age-old casteist fault-lines and ravaged by violent communal carnage in the aftermath of partition.

Despite massive under-accomplishment in terms of human development, as we look back at the years gone by, there are reasons to feel pride and satisfaction at the strides made in many aspects of the economy. **Achieving food security and raising significant share of the population above sustenance level are indeed creditable.**

_However deep down in the psyche of the nation lie the uneasy embers of how we understand and relate to the concepts of nationalism and patriotism._

**What is nationalism? In an absurd simplification, some people attempt to define it in terms of majoritarianism.** Those who do fail to appreciate the complexity of how majoritarian connotations can skew the lofty ideals of nationalism or patriotism. Both these concepts would be devoid of vitality and spirit if the vast sections of marginalised population do not feel passion about them.

One need not go far, but just look across the border to see how majoritarian assertion can reduce minority mindset, confidence and self-belief to tatters. Where did the sizeable number of minorities who opted to stay back in cities like Karachi and Lahore disappear?

**Surely, our Republic was not meant to acquiesce the attempts of numerical majority to trample the diversity and localised sensibilities of the grass-root societies.**

**Let us have the courage of conviction to admit that there have been and still are sporadic attempts to erect walls of majoritarian cultural fortification.** Such elements in the population are often emboldened by the illusion of passive support of the ruling dispensation. _Look at the storming of the Capitol Hill by right-wing White supremacist recently._ If so brazen an intrusion can take place in the citadel of American democracy, such aberration can indeed happen elsewhere too - if the culture of hate and exclusion is tolerated, let alone encouraged. _There are many lessons democracies can learn from the fall of Trump._ Democracy as an institution needs a benign and benevolent approach to weaker and differing viewpoints. There is simply no place for riding roughshod over dissent.

**This Republic Day, let us not be blind to the lurking dangers of overreach by extremist ideologies on either side of the political spectrum.** The maturity of a democracy is in its ability to tolerate and be concerned about the other view point. _I for one feel proud as an Indian that the protesting farmers can have a tractor march in Delhi on the same day, we have the ceremonial armed forces Parade._

**Patriotism** has outlived its narrow geographical meaning and has transcended to a truly ‘_vasudhaiva kudumbakam’ (the world as a family) outlook_ over the years. In the olden days most people used to live in or around their native village. They used to work in their family holding and shared the fruits of labour as a common possession. In the agrarian and feudalistic societies, family feuds and revenge fights were common. For survival, aggressive repulsion of the “outsiders” was more of a necessity. Gone are those days. **Today, people travel far and wide and many people earn their livelihood in places far away from their roots.** _One is often a ‘pravasi’ (emigrant) either in own country or abroad._ Naturally, the intense loyalty and sense of belonging to the place of birth or the immediate society where one grew up have diluted considerably. **People do develop affinity, comfort and even a sense of longing for the new found sanctuary of security, financial self-reliance and the behavioural congruence to the new cultural environment.**

**Patriotism is today more of a behavioural expression of** _esprit de corps_ (mix of belongingness and loyalty) **and spontaneity is the characteristic of patriotism.** _Any attempt to curate patriotism through targeted interventions would actually create a tendency to rebel or at least be indifferent_. That is why the regimentation of a communist or autocratic society does not gel with a liberal democracy spirit.

Further, _in a truly inclusive liberal democracy patriotism can’t have sponsors and patrons. No place for moral policing to enforce patriotism._ The challenge of nation building in a liberal democracy is to create a climate of care, compassion and facilitation. It makes most people to see, feel and internalise a spontaneous feeling of belongingness and mutuality of interests. **Education, parenting and peer relations are the foundations of positive nation building.**

_Nationalism and patriotism are therefore more of soft competencies that would get reinforced through positive behavioural outcomes of the social learning._

Let us therefore use the occasion of this unique Republic Day in the tapering phase of lockdown period to **introspect whether by acts or omissions we have helped ourselves and our families and friends to be more accommodative, open and caring.** If we allowed ourselves to be pawns in the manipulative chess game of wily politicians who benefit by playing up one against the other, it is time to regain our conscience and the right for free thinking and rising above walls of fragmentation.

Spontaneity, positivism, appreciation of diversity and respect for the right of another person to be different are the qualities that would make us worthy citizens of a liberal democracy. **A simple but valuable rededication to define nationalism and patriotism in broader and accretive manner is the need of the hour.**

Happy Republic Day Greetings!
