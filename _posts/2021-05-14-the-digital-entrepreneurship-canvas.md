In the midst of depressing news flow on Covid 19, any positive economic news is a great relief.

Here is one such news. It is interesting to examine how this news could be a harbinger of good tidings even as the clouds of the pandemic would clear out hopefully in the not-so-distant future.

The recent **Credit Suisse Global Report on Unicorns** highlights that **India is home to over 100 start-ups each with USD 1 Billion or more valuation.** _(A unicorn is a start-up that has reached a market capitalisation of USD 1 billion)_. According to the report, India has the third-largest count of unicorns globally, behind only USA and China.

There are 336 listed companies in the Indian bourses with individual market-cap of USD 1 Billion and above. As against this, there are now 100 unicorns in India with a combined market-cap of $240 billion. _Look at the strategic weight of the start-up pipeline in India!_

These and other potential unicorns would transform the corporate profile of Indian business scenario in the coming years. **A decade from now, many of today’s unicorns would have become the next Infosys, HCL Tech or Divis Lab.**

Going forward, we are bound to see much deeper global integration of Indian technology, market and capital flows. That would catalyse the emergence, maturing and growth of newer ventures. We are at the threshold of a massive disruption in the _entrepreneurial profile, business and operating models, funding funnel and marketing channels_ of the start-up ecosystem.

**The blue print for the post pandemic economy of India would emerge not from bureaucratic discussions or governmental diktats, but from imagination, perspiration and courage of our first-time entrepreneurs.** This future would be co-created by what APJ Abdul Kalam called _ignited minds._

**Business Ideation** **is breaking all stereotypes.** Yesterday’s fantasies are being converted to tomorrow’s reality by youngsters not afraid to tread on the unbeaten path. The entrepreneurial canvas is vast, the range is immense and opportunities huge.

_Business Standard_ reports that besides the favourite domains of start-ups such as e-commerce, financial technology (FinTech), education technology (Ed Tech), food delivery, and mobility applications, there is a rapidly growing number of new ventures under development in _Software-as-a-Service (SaaS), gaming, new-age distribution and logistics, biotech, healthcare and pharmaceuticals._

The era of ‘deep technology’ has arrived. **Deep technology is an umbrella term referring to innovations at the frontiers of science and technology.** Unlike legacy business ideation which focused on expanding or improvising proven and matured technologies, deep technology digs deep into the innovation cycle to identify _early-stage ideas with disruptive potential to develop products or services for tomorrow._

**Niche markets, emerging technologies and agile processes are the highlights of the new start-up mantra.** _The ideation, business model and operating processes of new generation start-ups_ would predominantly revolve around five strategic themes of **digital entrepreneurship canvas** - **Communication, Computing, Convergence, Cloud, and Conservation.**

_Firstly,_ **Communication is the pivot** around which digital ecosystem for start-up dynamics takes shape. We are today at the tipping point of massive rollout of 5G networks. Wireless networks have limitations in accessibility, denseness, bandwidth and cost-effectiveness. Hence, the future of 5G and subsequent generations of communication technologies would lie in **fibre-to-the- last-mile connectivity.** Satellite-aided ultra-high-speed networks are also under development.

As communication would evolve with increasing share of video/image and data-analytics, society is adapting to a blended model with remote and direct communication structure and this would drive communication infrastructure demand spiralling up in the coming decade.

Stand-alone voice would become a minor part of communication mix of future. Currently 5G roll-out is slow and dis-jointed but the pace and scale would cascade up over the next decade. Parallelly, the world would advance much beyond 5G. Entrepreneurs ideating on new ventures would do well to comprehend both the potential and the constraints of the communication scenario. More and more services would be delivered in the platform-based mode with subscription models that would optimise cost from both user and provider perspectives.

_Secondly,_ **Computing** power would be the strategic theme next in importance only to communication. Aided by the communication revolution, rapid strides in computational capabilities would transform societies and economies.

We are at the beginning of a new economic and technological cycle. The computational revolution has come a long way from the days of abacus and the analogue computing machines. Today, computing is being revolutionised by the combination of **Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning, Quantum Computing, Big Data and Blockchain.**

**Quantum Computing** is the future of computing and goes far beyond the supercomputers. **Quantum computing signals a paradigm shift beyond binary computing to multiple combinations of the binary framework** _(having on, off or an endless permutation of objectivity between on and off)._ This makes complex computations which pose challenges to supercomputers possible.

Real-time computing and applications for critical process industry, scientific research or ultra-fast global financial transactions would be enabled by quantum computing in future. **No wonder, development of quantum computing infrastructure, which is still a work in progress, would turn computing on its head.**

_Thirdly_, **Cloud** is emerging as the strategic framework for storage, security and access in our increasingly data-driven society. Enabled by superior communication and vastly enhanced computing power, we need to have expanded storage facility for data, image and video.

**Cloud-based computing, storage and communication** enhance the ease, access and security of computing enormously. Cloud also reduces cost of operations and storage enabling deployment of a range of pay-as-you-go service possible.

**Convergence,** the fourth theme, is the catalyst and integrator in the _ideation-development-fulfilment matrix_ of the digital business cycle. Convergence brings together technologies, processes and governance models to craft the go-to-market strategies for commercialisation of ideas.

_Starting from the ultimate customer profile, the digital business model works backward to string together the entire product and services value chain._ Cross-functional appreciation and ability to keep the big picture are key competencies for convergence.

**Not only technology convergence and adaptions but also alignment with techno-commercial and governance parameters, guidelines and standards pose innumerable challenges in business ideation and planning.**

In the digital business model, development of applications and design of platform-based service delivery are critical to enhance customer experience and market expansion. It is here that convergence plays a key role in defining products and services, designing delivery processes and capturing ‘near real-time’ feedback and quality assurance parameters.

_Fifthly, today’s business ideation needs to be mindful of_ the increasing global focus on **Conservation.** With **Environment-Social-Governance (ESG)** theme gaining prominence in investment flows, _green energy, nature preservation, carbon neutrality and recycling of non-renewable resources have emerged as potential triggers for business ideation._ You need to comply with and align to the global environment and business ethics standards and guidelines to be able to attract Venture Capital funding and key market access.

One of the core areas of business ideation around the conservation theme is Electric Mobility. **Solar energy and lithium battery technologies are of particular focus as part of the broader conservation theme.** Tremendous research and ideation initiatives are on globally in multiple areas of conservation. There is huge untapped potential for wealth creation and employment generation in a host of conservation initiatives from automobile scrappage, reducing dependence on fossil fuel, waste management and plastic recycling to mention just a few.

**Social Enterprises** which address societal needs would be occupying greater entrepreneurial space in the next decade. _Affordable pricing for accessible technologies through simple, transparent processes would be the mantra for social entrepreneurship._

Digitalisation has opened up many areas of traditional civic administration and mundane public governance to possible social investment. Crowd-funding, tapping CSR support, taking governmental support and subsidies and accessing multilateral development agency funding can provide the capital needs for many social enterprises.

Entrepreneurs and start-up enthusiasts would do well to comprehend the strategic significance of these five themes around which substantial investments would ensue in the coming decade.

_Tomorrow’s unicorns will be built by those who break free of silo-based thinking, are not afraid to go beyond one’s comfort zone and are keen to get an outside-in perspective of the market needs._

And, Digital is the Way to Go! Smarter entrepreneurs see through the current gloom and dream about the Day After.
