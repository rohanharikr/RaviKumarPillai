Peacock is the National Bird of India. Known for its exquisite charm and peaceful demeanor, the bird radiates a synergy with nature. However, the typical Indian social behavior seems more aligned to the ostrich than to peacock. We bury our heads in sand and pretend not to see our own faults, prejudices and biases.

Intolerance is seemingly deep routed in our social psyche. Most people consider it quite normal to hate, spread lies, prejudge, typecast and exclude those with different lifestyles, habits, thinking and beliefs. Look around and listen to the hush voices of frustration and alienation in the air. Wake up to the reality of the walls that we have been busy building. Intolerance manifests in innumerable ways in our way of life.

Few years back, I was appointed as the Managing Director of a Government of Kerala enterprise upon my selection through a transparent process. I had come from the corporate sector and my education, belief system and experience probably positioned me as a rank outsider to the setting. There were couple of IAS officials in the Board of the company. When I found that they abstained from Board Meetings, I inquired with the Corporate Secretary about possible reasons. I was told that as ‘privileged’ civil servants, they did not as a convention attend Board Meetings when the Chief Executive was not one of their own tribe. I do not know, whether the culture has changed _now. It was a crude encounter for me with bureaucratic intolerance._

_Compared to the crass intolerance that ordinary citizens face day in and day out, my experience was nothing to write home about._ In office, academic institutions and most formal set ups, we come across behaviors involving open and oblique clannishness.

We seem to be a classificatory society; we look for reasons to organize into exclusive clusters within the larger social space. Alumni of colleges, coming from a locality, belonging to certain communities, based on political leanings, trade union affinities …… the list of fragmented identities is endless. We feel more at ease belonging to the part than to the whole!

**When it gets into the social domain, the classificatory culture gets nastier.**

Take the example of Aslam. As a newly appointed officer in a nationalised bank, Aslam arrives at one of the highly polarised cities in India and seeks to settle down into an established housing society. He might simply be refused the opportunity because his religion or eating habits are not aligned to majority of the occupants in the community.

In Bengaluru, it is common to see young techies frantically running around for housing because landlords are typically reluctant to rent out to bachelors, more so to single women.

**In films, sports, business and official domains, gender insensitivities are rampant.** I remember once we were boarding a plane and as the welcome announcement came from the lady captain, the gentleman next to me in his safari suite and with a mouthful of pan masala exclaimed, _“Pilot Aurat hai kya? Hamen to dar lagta hai?”_ Misogyny, caste biases and regional prejudices are among the most common forms of intolerance in the Indian society.

If you think intolerance is restricted to geographies with relatively low Human Development Index, you are mistaken. We recently heard a senior politician in Kerala making a loaded comment on the international compliments received by the State Health Minister for her stellar performance in combating the Covid challenges. I could only mumble, “ Old habits hesitate to die down”!

Whether it is the continuing story of _racial prejudices against migrants from the North East_, ugly manifestations of _caste-based marginalization_, _prejudices against minorities_, exclusionary _attitudes to LGBT_ community or _linguistic and regional bigotry_, intolerance is widely practiced in the world’s largest democracy.

**Political intolerance** is a virus that gets protection and encouragement by parties of various hues. _Grass root workers and mercenaries of parties take intolerance to the level of physical violence._ Stories of political violence from certain pockets in Northern Kerala have been making headlines for all the wrong reasons, till a few months back. How many youths in our schools and colleges had to sacrifice their lives in mindless clashes in and around campuses?

**Emotional intolerance** is even more virulent and contagious than physical intolerance. Bullying, harassment, blocking normal and deserved progress in career and professions are woven into the contemporary culture in India. Marital discords, violence to spouses and neglect of the elderly are manifestation of emotional intolerance. Blatant selfishness and an ill-placed sense of entitlement based on ‘status’(or _self-importance_) drive intolerance to a pathological obsession. Though intolerance drives the target population to distress and alienation, it also displays the lack of self-confidence of the protagonists.

Bertrand Russell, the archetypal role model of free thinking spoke of the biases in society, **“Collective fear stimulates herd instinct, and tends to produce ferocity toward those who are not regarded as members of the herd.”** Doesn’t this ring a bell in the instances mob lynching, honour killing and caste atrocities that keep happening.

The rural landscape of India, especially in traditional societies is replete with instances of harassment and punitive brutality at the hands of the village councils and the archaic _‘khap’_ (community) panchayats. These are manifestations of gross social injustice perpetrated with acquiescence, and often connivance, of the powers that be. _Caste is at the root of our culture of intolerance. It is an anachronism in the current times and the social stratification based on caste is nothing short of apartheid._

Of all intolerances, **intellectual intolerance is the most orchestrated and manipulated type.** The feigned and harvested sectarian intolerance is indeed fodder to the self-seeking politicians. Any one who stands for free thinking and critical inquiry can be branded as an outlier, anti-national or urban Naxalite.

Look at the fuss we make about a book, movie or play that depicts a view point not aligned to the conservative narrative. If you ban, condemn or boycott an idea it is natural that mere curiosity would draw many people to it.

**How do we deal with the entrenched virus of intolerance in our society?** We have ignored it, swept it under the carpet and tolerated it for too long. The virus of intolerance is indeed a cancer on the social fabric and it feeds on the emotions and sensibilities of citizens. It undergoes dangerous mutations impacting the way we perceive, relate to and support each other.

Mother Teresa said in plain and simple words, _“If you **judge** people, you have no time to **love** them.”_ This is the problem with contemporary society. Instead of judging others, if only we could accept and accommodate the diversity in society, the world would be much less stressful and enjoyable to live and let live. The malaise of intolerance can be neutralized only if we recognize and acknowledge that it exists. Denial doesn’t solve any of our problems.

There is a **time-tested triple vaccine that does wonders in preparing the society to free itself from the legacy of intolerance.** I would call it the _Triple E Vaccine – education, empowerment and engagement_.

_Public education_ should inculcate positive values such as social inclusion, scientific temperament, empathy and self-care. _Empowerment_ of women is the single most important mantra for eliminating intolerance in society. Focus of education should also prepare individuals to think and act freely without surrendering oneself to manipulative brain washing. _Engagement_ in governance should go much beyond the electoral participation if intolerance is to be erased from various walks of life. Transparency of policies and processes prepares the ground for an engaged society.

The danger of not being clear what and how much should be tolerated in the name of liberalism was brought out by Karl Popper, an influential Austrian social scientist of the 1940’s. He coined a powerful expression for the dilemma of liberalism - _“The Paradox of Tolerance.”_ He wrote in his 1945 book, _The Open Society and Its Enemies_, “If we extend unlimited tolerance even to those who are intolerant, if we are not prepared to defend a tolerant society against the onslaught of the intolerant, then the tolerant will be destroyed, and tolerance with them.” Wily politicians often promote intolerant fringe outfits as a bait to provoke the sensibilities of the larger tolerant majority. They have grown their influence by fishing in troubled waters and they are hesitant to let go of the time-tested technique.

The solution lies in increased citizen awareness of the **value of inclusion, diversity, tolerance and mutual support.** It is the duty of every right-thinking person to promote free thinking, respect of divergent views and empowerment of the marginalized. Parenting and schooling have to have more focus on social orientation and building positivism. Instead of branding academic activism as a threat, it should be seen more as opportunity for fast tracking the social evolution. Universities should be seen as and encouraged to be melting pots of diversity where free thinking and shared vision can be curated.

At the ripe age nearly seventy five, Indian democracy needs to be confident enough to encourage dialogue, dissent, debate and alternative thinking. Suppressed dissent is more a sign of weakness than strength.
