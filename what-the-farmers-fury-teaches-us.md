The anger of the farmers, mainly from Punjab and Haryana, over the recent reforms relating to farm products marketing is boiling to brims. It has already spilled over to the streets of Delhi disrupting traffic and normal life. The demonstrations threaten to develop into a full-blown crisis for Narendra Modi Government. The space for meaningful consensus to address the pinpricks of the legislation seems to be shrinking by the day.

There is not an iota of doubt that in its current form the law is loaded with possibilities for apprehensions and misinterpretations from the perspectives of farmers long used to the comfort zone of Agricultural Produce Marketing Committees (APMC) framework. The farmers seemingly have genuine apprehensions on various issues like the continuance of Minimum Support Price (MSP) in the medium to long term, possible discontinuance of APMC _mandis_, adverse impact on quantity, price and payments for food produce trade as well as the non-judicial nature of the proposed dispute resolution mechanism. Each one of them is critical for the grass root farmer and it is indeed curious why these vital points were left ambiguous in the legislation. Yet another example of how undue hurry and bureaucratic drafting affect the quality of our legislation.

The Prime Minister who took up some of the long-delayed and well-meaning reforms is confronted with a dilemma that potentially can dent his political capital and image as a risk-taker. For the dispirited Opposition, the crisis has not come a day too soon and could well be the life-support it desperately needed.

**What has gone wrong? Has the PM for once failed to sense the mood on the ground?** The swelling fury of farmers holds invaluable lessons for our democratic governance.

Democracy does not get strengthened by denial of crises but instead by the willingness of the Government to seek meaningful insights from them and by fine-tuning governance.

In the continuum of political evolution, moments like the present are invaluable opportunities to unlearn and realign strategies and processes for handling delicate reforms. Let us look at a few of the key learning points from the ongoing imbroglio.

_Firstly_, democracy in action is not a stereo typed process; instead, it is an ever-melting cauldron of expectations, interests, lobbying and expression.

Drafting and getting the legislation through the House is just the visible part of law making. A good law is the outcome of an iterative process involving debates, discussion, dissent, accommodation and refinement. **When the process of consultation and critical examination of legislation is given a short shrift, the quality and wholesomeness of law making suffers.** Further, the misalignment of an enacted legislation with the aspirations and apprehensions of the stakeholders can create hiccups on the ground as is the case in the farm legislations now.

There is a popular quote attributed to Abraham Lincoln about planning and executing tasks, “Give me six hours to chop down a tree and I will spend the first four sharpening the axe”. This as much applicable to legislation as to any project. **Rectifying lapses in a legislation is both cumbersome and a terrible loss of face for the Government.** Getting it right the first time is important. Hence the need to follow extensive consultation, review, feedback and improvement before the enactment. Especially in the case of economic legislations with mass impact a process of detailed select committee consultation must be part of legislation.

_Secondly,_ democracy has the knack of passing on the baton to the wider body of participants much beyond the body of elected representatives. Truly, **people power does transcend the limits of legislative structure. May be, time has come to practice participative and bottom-up law making** as opposed to laws being drafted by the bureaucrat-legislator duo far removed from the grassroot realities of the target population. _The openness and accessibility of a digital society offer opportunity for active, alive and transparent law making. _Such a process would obviously result in wider ownership and better alignment of the new laws.

_Thirdly,_ empathy is at the core of political leadership. When the overarching quality of empathy, care and concern for the public is deficient, there is danger of governance degenerating to authoritarian and prescriptive style. **However good the intentions may be, if the process of governance displays top-down rather than participative style, credibility gap becomes perceptible.** Needless to say, imposed compliance is transient while voluntary involvement by the wider population vests longevity, consistency and commitment from the society at large.

_Fourthly,_ ego has little place in a vibrant and inclusive democracy**. Common good gives way to interest groups and isolated perceptions.** When a law would possibly hurt a significant share of participant universe, it is only fair and reasonable for the Government to look for improvisations and amendments without standing on prestige and rigidity. _Openness to change based on feedback and comments makes the democracy alive and kicking._

_Fifthly**,**_ **politics in a liberal and open democracy is a dynamic interface between public perception and social behaviour.** The narrative that was carefully built up over the past few years of a transformational leader with a “56-inch chest” would suffer severe dent if the PM retracts on the law after taking a considered view on farm reforms as “must do”.

We have seen how an over-sensitive Modi retracted from the land acquisition reforms in the wake of churlish taunts of _“suit-boot-ka-sarkar”_ in the initial days of his first term. That one move in fact pushed back by years the much-needed drive to boost global competitiveness and ease of business. **This time, if the Government goes back on farm reforms, the blow the move would deliver to our attempt to rejuvenate the economy and bring our agriculture to global standards would be severe.** Any soft-footedness on this count would open up possible pressures to push back labour reforms as well.

_The Government is in a “Catch 22” situation. The loudmouths in the Treasury benches and the party have hardly helped in diffusing the situation by airing insults and insinuations on the agitating farmers._

**Modi’s moment for statesman-like response is here.** What is expected from the PM is a calibrated and patient response which demonstrates genuine empathy for farmers while ensuring that administrative authority and governance precedence are not diluted. **Regaining the eroded trust and assuring a consistent support for farmers to get over their apprehensions on the reforms through actions on the ground would salvage the situation.** In the meanwhile, the nation should be ready and willing to wait for a while and make the farmers feel that genuinely the whole country is sensitive to their perception of the situation.

As for the Opposition and the social activists hustling to throw their hats in the ring, a sane advice would be, “In your keenness to score brownie points over the Government, please do not entangle this country in a few more years of tryst with mediocrity and rigidity. W owe it our future generations to facilitate change for the better.”

The next few weeks are crucial and patience and long-term perspectives are what we expect from the politicians of all hues.
