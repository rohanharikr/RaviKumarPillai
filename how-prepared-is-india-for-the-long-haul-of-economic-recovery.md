It is said that going downhill is easy, but climbing back is quite an effort. It is true of nations and economies as much as for individuals. Downward journey is hardly voluntary. We do not plan to go downhill, aspirations are always to climb up the ladder of competence, wealth and influence. However, regression on progress and prosperity does happen due to emergence of risks for which we are not prepared. Covid pandemic has produced one such inflection point.

How nations prepare themselves for the strenuous haul back to normalcy and advancement would determine the new pecking order post the pandemic. World Economic Forum(WEF), the Davos (Switzerland)-based think tank of global though-leaders and strategists has come out with a special edition of Global Competitiveness Report in the beginning of 2021 focusing on **“How Countries are Performing on the Road to Recovery”.** The Report provides an insightful agenda and ominous status-check on the preparedness of nations for recovery and growth.

It is especially relevant to look at how India fares among the comity of nations in the scramble to get ready for the post-Covid challenges and opportunities. For precisely three reasons, India’s state of preparedness attracts critical examination.

_Firstly_, **the wider world, especially the liberal democracies and multilateral funding and development institutions expect India to emerge as a counter-weight to China**’s aggressive push to be the leading economy of the world. They are eager to see whether India can indeed measure up to the task and that too within the near to medium term.

_Secondly,_ the PM and Government have upped the narrative of an aspirational India aiming to become a USD 5 Trillion economy in the next few year. Though the call for _Atmnirbhar Bharat_ does sound a jaded formula that fitted more appropriately to the ecosystem of 1960sor 70s, **there are many people who would like to disregard the semantics and look for substance, strategy and commitment on the part of Government to leap at the ambitious target.**

_Thirdly,_ there are indeed supporting factors like **demographic advantage of a young workforce, a varied and experienced corporate mix spanning a range of traditional and emerging business domains and a geopolitical environment that is much more favourably inclined to Indian role** and collaboration than at any time in the past. _The challenge for India is to diplomatically manoeuvre Chinese machinations with tact, restraint and accommodation._

In this benign context and in the wake of immense possibilities, what is the story on the ground? _Are we in the game of upping our global competitiveness with the seriousness, focus and commitment that the situation demands?_

The latest WFM Report specially focuses on “_the priorities and policies needed to reboot economic systems in the longer run_ to achieve sustainable and inclusive prosperity over the next 3-5 years”

The Report talks about lessons for Governments from the Covid experience. Essentially, going forward **nations need to reboot governance with strategic depth and long-term orientation** so that not only do economies recover fast but also build resilience to meet similar contingencies that could arise in future.

More and more nations would zero-in on a focussed agenda for economic recovery resting on **five pillars**:

1\. Health Services upgrade

2\. Skill Development

3\. Globalization and Strategic Alignment

4\. Digitalisation

5\. Structural Reforms and Governance Process improvement

Let us look at how India fares against these agenda items and what lies ahead in terms of opportunities and challenges for us.

_Firstly_, **Public Health Services have unfortunately not got the required attention in India’s governance and budgetary allocations over the years.** Health Infrastructure build-up, quality of service delivery and process enhancements suffered due partly to the lopsided structure of Centre-State power sharing envisaged by the Constitution. Till very recently, federal spending on boosting health infrastructure has been minimal.

_In the absence of adequate and efficient public spending and infrastructure upgrade, the health services delivery pipeline got skewed in favour of private investment._ The lack of balance between public and private health care facilities meant that the public had to take recourse to costly private health care for want of alternative. _When healthcare become captive to affordability, the general health index suffers badly._

In the meanwhile, the public health administration in most states got mired in a culture of graft, leakages and nepotism, traits reinforced through decades of governance slackness.

**Time has come to rejig the strategic focus on universal public health services, the most vital pillars of human development. Spending on Health as a percentage of GDP needs to quadruple both at Centre and States** – more so for those States low down in the pecking order on these counts.

_The second_ priority area is **Comprehensive Skill Development**. The WEF Report says that _among the G-20 nations, India fares the worst in terms of skill-set adequacy to meet the post Covid economic opportunities and challenges._

Among school educated and university graduate categories, **India’s score on skill adequacy deteriorated by nearly 25% during the period 2016-2020 as against a gain of 10 to 15% recorded over the same period by China and South Korea.** Lack of focus, commitment and collaboration across the federal spectrum could be the reasons for this state of affairs. In India, the gap between political rhetoric and ground realities has been the most pronounced in this vital aspect of development.

**If we have to gain global manufacturing competitiveness, national skill development strategies, plans and programs need urgent and holistic upgrade.** Academic-Industry-Government triad has to work in sync on mission mode to prepare the talent readiness. **Real and meaningful monetary and tax incentivisation of organized sector for skill development in both fresh and experience categories should be considered as a policy initiative.**

_Thirdly,_ **we need to align the idea of _Atmnirbhar Bharat_ to the strategic need to leverage global alliances, partnerships and trade relations.** If _Atmnirbhar_ means competence advancement and collaboration building to attract emerging technologies, capital inflows and global supply-chain linkages, it would help scale up our commercial and economic clout. But **if we fall prey to the temptations of protective insulation of our economy, the result would be regressive in the long term.**

_When pushed beyond a point, aggressive nationalism can do more harm than good._ Look at how Trump’s _Make America Great Again_ campaign in fact reduced America’s global positioning and influence drastically over a span of just four years. **It is time for us to define ‘_Atmnirbhar’ as_ a positive and inviting global proposition by India opening up for capital, technology, talent and trade.**

_Fourthly,_ digitalisation did indeed become the saviour in limiting the impact of the sudden lockdowns and immobility. The WEF Report states emphatically that **governments which had built out the digital delivery of public services were much better placed to disburse emergency funding to distressed companies and households.** In India, digital technology enabled direct transfer of benefits and cash support to millions of needy households affected by loss of jobs and reverse migration. Can you imagine what a mess it would have been without the _Jan Dhan_ Accounts and digitally beefed-up public distribution network? **We need to fast-track the digitalisation of public service delivery to expand its reach, coverage, variety and efficiency. 5-G rollout to be fast-tracked is therefore a key priority for the nation.**

_Fifthly,_ **reforms need to be speeded up to bring in transparency, eliminate scope for personal discretion and nepotism as well as to plug loopholes for leakage of public money.** Tremendous progress has been achieved by some States in digital delivery of public services. This needs to be the national agenda and should break the barriers of entitlement and privileges of the better endowed.

In addition to structural reforms, process review and continuous improvement to achieve efficient and effective services to the public are important for sustainable development push.

The Vaccine Rollout has started and hopefully would go through with the least glitches. Economic activities have started looking up. May be in a year’s time, unless there is a threat from a mutant virus, the Covid interregnum would pass as a nightmare that struck humanity hard and sudden. But **the lessons from the past year would have hopefully changed the global perception of risk and ability to respond with agility to crises for ever.**

Afterall, at the end of the pain and loss of yesterday, the serene and refreshing dawn would herald a more optimistic future for humanity. Hopefully, a better prepared India would be in a stronger position to take emerging economic challenges head on.
