				<p>Why do many star students end up as mediocre performers in career and life? Some would be severely bruised in the battles of life. <em>In spite of academic brilliance, winning scholarships, getting in to prestigious universities or even landing cushy jobs, many early achievers fail to ascend the success ladder in later years.</em></p>

<p><strong>What is it that holds back seemingly intelligent, hardworking and ambitious youngsters from being sure-fire winners as they move on?</strong> Or, have we got it all wrong about our understanding of intelligence itself?</p>

<p>The popular perception of intelligence is smartness or cleverness. Due to the widely-held notion that intelligent people are likely to succeed in life, many parents are obsessed with Intelligence Quotient (IQ), the quantitative measure of intelligence. <strong>IQ tests have been venerated by many as the gold-standard of ability and potential.</strong> Above-average IQ score is considered as sign of future achievements. Lower IQ scores are taken as portending gloom and doom in career and life. <strong>Both these extreme perceptions could be awfully wrong.</strong></p>

<p>A look at the evolution of intelligence as a concept would be appropriate to place our discussion in perspective. IQ was proposed by the French psychologist <strong>Alfred Binet way back in 1904</strong> to measure the mental ability of children. In the same year, <strong>Charles Spearman</strong>, a British scholar came up with the concept of <a href="https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-general-intelligence-2795210">general intelligence</a> or the ‘g factor’. He <strong>saw intelligence as a general ability that can be measured and numerically expressed.</strong> Subsequent psychologists, however, found the use of generalised intelligence or g-score as too simplistic.</p>

<p>Today, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wechsler_Adult_Intelligence_Scale" title="Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale">Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wechsler_Intelligence_Scale_for_Children" title="Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children">Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children</a> are widely used to measure intelligence. <strong>David Wechsler</strong>, the American Psychologist who proposed the above scales, saw intelligence as an aggregate of a variety of capabilities. He defined intelligence as <em>“the <strong>global capacity</strong> of a person to <strong>act purposefully</strong>, to <strong>think rationally</strong>, and to <strong>deal effectively</strong> with (behavioural) environment.”</em></p>

<p>The measure of average IQ is set at 100. Around sixty-eight percent of IQ scores fall within one standard deviation of this average. Most people are therefore expected to be between 85 and 115 in their IQ, which is considered the normal range of intelligence.</p>

<p>People with an IQ above 140 are referred to as prodigies. Those with IQ above 160 qualify in common perception as genius. IQ score below 80 is considered indicative of learning deficiency that needs support and guidance to cope with normal learning requirements. From a neuro-sciences perspectives, Intelligence has complex genetic and physio-chemical dimensions. To a significant extent, the embryonic and childhood stages of development do influence human intelligence. This explains why the mean IQ scores vary according to geographical, cultural and economic conditions. Going by several studies, the mean IQ score for Indians is around 82, while for South East Asian Nations it is approximately 102-105; Europe and the US have mean scores around 98-99.</p>

<p>Several studies have highlighted the impact of economic factors on the mean IQ level of a population. Factors that have been positively associated with higher IQ include nutrition, public health, regular and good quality schooling, environmental hygiene, parenting effectiveness and opportunity for developing soft skills, creativity and aesthetics. Therefore, quality of governance has a major contribution on the generational ascendancy of mean IQ of a society.</p>

<p><strong>Can IQ be developed or is it something with which we are born and are therefore stuck with for life?</strong></p>

<p>To succeed in career and life, we need capabilities beyond the ability to comprehend ideas, analyse and interpret factual and behavioural cues. <strong>It is here that the broader and intricate world of multiple intelligences come to play.</strong> The evolution of the concept of Multiple Intelligences resulted from extensive research by psychologists. When he proposed the idea of multiple intelligence in 1983, Professor Howard Gardner of Harvard University revolutionized our understanding of intelligence dramatically. According to him, human intelligence comprises of multiple dimensions, each representing different ways of processing information. <em>It is not the linear intelligence that triggers our understanding and actions but an intricate and interfacing mesh of intelligences.</em></p>

<p>He elaborated on eight intelligences – verbal (linguistic), logical (mathematical), visual, musical, naturalistic, kinesthetics, interpersonal and intrapersonal. He expected more types of intelligences would evolve over time. In today’s context, digital intelligence is a critical success factor.</p>

<p>For ease of understanding, we can categorise multiple intelligences into three buckets – <strong>cognitive intelligence, emotional intelligence and social intelligence.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Cognitive intelligence</strong> forms the core of what most people consider intelligence - measured by IQ Tests. Very closely aligned to the three R’s of learning - Reading, Writing and Arithmetic -this layer of intelligence is at the base of our hierarchy of learning and behavioural capabilities.</p>

<p><strong>Emotional Intelligence</strong> is concerned with self-awareness and regulating own emotions so as to relate and respond appropriately to situations and people. If cognitive intelligence can be considered as the foundation, then emotional intelligence represents the pillars of the structure of competence.</p>

<p>Peter Salovey and John D. Mayer who coined the term ‘Emotional Intelligence’ in 1990 described it as <em>the ability to monitor one’s own and others’ feelings and emotions, to discriminate among them, and to use this information to guide one’s thinking and action”</em>. <strong>Daniel Goleman,</strong> the celebrated author of “Social Intelligence: The New Science of Social Relationships” (2006) helped evolve Emotional Intelligence as a field of immense relevance in predicting and developing leadership capabilities.</p>

<p>Goleman developed the social dimension of intelligence and proposed an effective blending of self and social behavioural competencies for success. <strong>Social Intelligence</strong> is the ability to relate, respond and collaborate with others to achieve shared goals_._ Social intelligence deals with two of the eight dimensions of the multiple intelligence framework of Gardner – interpersonal and intrapersonal intelligence. In the pantheon of multiple intelligences, <em>cognitive intelligence</em> reflects learning ability, <em>emotional intelligence</em> is concerned with self-awareness and self-regulation and <em>social intelligence</em> drives relationships and influences in a group setting, be it family, society or organizations.</p>

<p>Why do some people succeed in career and life while many others do not? <em>It</em> depends not as much on their intelligence as on their ability to perform what is expected of them. In that sense, success is an outcome more of behaviours than knowledge or skills.</p>

<p><strong>The question that many people ask is whether and how one can improve the ability to accomplish what we set out to do?</strong></p>

<p><em>Applying multiple intelligences with focus, clarity and commitment is what enables us to deliver results</em>, manage outcomes and lead teams. When we use multiple intelligences to behave or respond in a positive and outcome-focused manner, we move closer to realising the goals and targets that we set out to accomplish.</p>

<p><strong>Competent individuals, organizations and societies are focused, action-oriented and pursue outcome effectiveness.</strong> The journey from intelligence to competence requires commitment, consistency and perseverance. Cognitive capabilities might be influenced by genetic and neuro-linguistic elements. But social and emotional competence are domains that can be learned, developed, practiced and internalised.</p>

<p>Parental and early learning interventions can facilitate behavioural competence development at the formative stage. Competency-based education, training, coaching and mentoring can help in continuous development of career and life competence.</p>

<p>Intelligence is not a static concept; nor is it a burden of legacy. Academics and corporate learning would increasingly adopt competency-based approach leveraging the advancements in digital technologies to craft and deliver personalised and outcome- based competence development.</p>
