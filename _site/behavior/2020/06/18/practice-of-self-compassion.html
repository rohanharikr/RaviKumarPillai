				<p>Sushant Singh Rajput was an extremely talented and ambitious actor. His performances had a refreshing glow and authenticity that was rare to come by so early in career. He impressed as a rank outsider who by his tenacity and commitment was on the verge of breaking out big time on Bollywood. The news-break about Sushant putting an end to his life was shocking and unbelievable.</p>

<p>Why did a successful, young actor with a promising career ahead of him opt to commit suicide? This is not by any means an isolated incident. Why do children, brought up in pampered care decide to end their lives apparently on as frivolous a reason as not getting a smart phone of choice or not being allowed to have free access to internet? What drives young lives with great potential to descend to despair, isolation and despondency? Apparently, something seems to have gone awfully wrong in the emotional well-being of our society.</p>

<p>Social connect and active interactions are critical to emotional health. Isolation and insecurity make an unsettling potion for distress.</p>

<p>The horrifying loneliness that cracks the will to survive is why solitary confinement is deemed to be one of the deadliest forms of punishment. I remember waiting with bated breath for the live BBC telecast of Nelson Mandela walking out of prison in 1990 after internment for 27 years. He wrote in his autobiography, ‘The Long Walk to Freedom’<em>,</em> “In those years, isolation became a habit. We were routinely charged for the smallest infractions and sentenced to isolation. <em>I found solitary confinement the most forbidding aspect of prison life. There was no end and no beginning; there is only one’s own mind, which can begin to play tricks”</em></p>

<p>His eyes radiated an intense mix of forgiveness and calm as he took his first few steps as a free man after spending much of his active years confined to the jail. There was no remorse, no anger visible. But then, everyone is not Nelson. Most human beings tend to wilt under the burden of social disconnect. Despondency tends to take over.</p>

<p>For snapping social engagement, one need not be in confinement. While living amidst our folks, we can still emotionally experience lack of care, support and comfort. Disengagement within family, community and the larger society takes a toll on the emotional resilience of individuals. Since no two human beings are alike, their response to failures, disappointments and uncertainties would vary too.</p>

<p>Emotionally most people are like an iceberg; what is visible and experienced by others is just a tiny bit of us. <strong>People form opinions and judgement of one another based on incomplete and subjective perceptions.</strong> Our self-image, emotional regulation, relationship building and messaging define our social behavior. In the fast paced and increasingly competitive world, most people are in a rat race to grab opportunities, outsmart competitors and score brownie points.</p>

<p><strong>Expectations and comparisons are the sources of most of our emotional vulnerabilities.</strong> As children grow up, their parenting, instructional and social experiences tend to reinforce negativity as much as positive feelings. Life experiences are not a zero-sum game; those with predominantly unsatisfying and nourishing emotional experiences as children go on to face adult life with their baggage of skewed beliefs and perceptions.</p>

<p>Based on studies by LANCET, the prestigious international medical journal and the estimates by World Health Organization, <strong>as of 2019 the number of people in India with manifested mental disorders or proneness to them is in the range of 200 to 250 million.</strong> <em>Out of this nearly 100 million suffer from two of the most common emotional distresses – depression and anxiety syndromes.</em></p>

<p><strong>Depression has been cited as the primary motivator in more than fifty percent of all suicides, globally.</strong> Persisting depression can trigger great emotional pain and loss of hope, inhibiting ability to face adversities with resilience. Pent up frustrations and repeated failures may drive people with fragile self-image to drug abuse, alcoholism or the extreme step of ending own life. <strong>These actions are punishment inflicted on self just like an irate parent trying harsh methods to discipline a child</strong>. Here, individuals perceive own self as an adversary not worthy of love, kindness and compassion. <em>As a society, we in India do not teach children to recognize, comfort and encourage themselves, though we would like to cultivate the very same behaviors in children towards others.</em></p>

<p>It is here that the relevance of positive psychology comes in. <strong>Positive psychology</strong> is the <em>science of wellness, positivism, goodness and accommodation</em>. Happiness and well-being are essentially behavioral in nature. Positive psychology has heavy imprints of the oriental philosophy. Buddhist ideal of compassion is at its core. The concepts of <em>Karma, Maya and Yoga</em> have a great influence on positive psychology. A belief in the cause and effect theory is underscored by most religions. “A man reaps what he sows” says The Bible.</p>

<p>Behaviorally, emotional imprints of our actions get stored in memory. Later experiences get interpreted in the context of our past actions. Remorse and frustration about life events and experiences could lead to self-guilt and lowering of self-image. Conscious practice of goodness, compassion and accommodation would enhance the feeling of wellness in us.</p>

<p>American Psychologist Martin Seligman, who did commendable work on the science of wellness, proposed the <strong>PERMA framework of positive psychology – P for Positive emotions, E for Engagement, R for Relationships, M for Meaning or Purpose and A for Accomplishment or Achievement.</strong> <em>These five elements would contribute immensely towards building and nurturing a culture of inclusion, empathy and happiness.</em> It is possible to develop these finer shades of emotional well-being through guided practice.</p>

<p>Within positive psychology, Self-Compassion is a powerful concept. Dr. Kristin Neff was motivated by Buddhist meditation to pursue her doctoral research in self-compassion. She took up self-compassion research and training with a missionary zeal. <strong>Having self-compassion means being able to relate to yourself in a way that’s forgiving, accepting, and loving, even in stressful context.</strong></p>

<p>Self-Compassion has three pillars:</p>

<p>Ø <strong>Kindness</strong> : Being kind and understanding toward oneself when experiencing pain or failure rather than being harshly self-critical. <em>Love your own self and care to give the emotional soothing to your inner self at times of stress</em>.</p>

<p>Ø **See the Big Picture: **Perceiving one’s experiences as part of the larger human experience rather than seeing them in isolation. <em>Ability to perceive any unpleasant event as part of the continuum of life experiences</em> would motivate us to seek opportunities for self-improvement rather than worry about obstacles.</p>

<p>Ø <strong>Mindfulness :</strong> Living in the present moment and making things happen rather than worrying about the past or over-expectations about future. If today, this moment is what matters most, we put our best efforts on the action on hand. <em>“Karmanyeva Adhikaraste”</em>, says Bhagavad Gita. Focus on Action and the consequences would follow.</p>

<p>When you are down, when things don’t seem to be going your way, that is when you need support, a shoulder to lean on. What if the support, when you need it most, is offered by the one who knows you inside out – your own self? If you are capable of getting into an objective dialogue with self, argue it out with your own consciousness about the need to change course, you would generate immense positivism, openness and critical thinking.</p>

<p>Self-Compassion would logically lead to increased self-awareness, self-regulation and resilience. When you are your own best friend and at the same time the most constructive critic of yourself, the process of self-dialogue would turn out to be an enriching experience.</p>

<p>All of us would feel tense at times, depressed and desperately in need of soothing emotional strokes. With practice and commitment, we can convert our inner self to be the best friend ever. The key to that is mindfulness. Living in the present. When we live in the present, there is little time for remorse or self-pity. We don’t live among fancy dreams of tomorrow nor do we lament over lost chances. <em>Reflect, journalise and critically review your own experiences. Spend a brief fifteen-minute session at the end of each day counselling and mentoring yourself.</em></p>

<p>This way, we can neutralize our small irritations and tiny disappointments from building up to be formidable avalanche that could derail emotional stability, composure and sound reasoning. We owe it to ourselves to take good care of self. Once we are at peace with ourselves, our empathy, relation and communication with others would also be on healthier footing.</p>

<p>It is time positive psychology becomes an integral part of our school curriculum. Seeds of a healthier and happier society need to be sown early in life.</p>
