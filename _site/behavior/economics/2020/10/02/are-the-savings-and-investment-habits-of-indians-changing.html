				<p>The other day I caught up with three of my friends to relieve myself from the isolation of being confined to the ‘new normal’ of work-from-home. As it has turned out for most people, WFM has come to mean ‘more work and less home’. All the talk of not carrying your home to office and office to home has melted away in WFM regimen. People however find newer passions and pastimes aligned with their changed routine.</p>

<p>Two of the three friends confided that they are into their new found interest – they have started retail investment in stocks. Like them, an increasing number of professionals and self-employed have taken to financial markets during the lockdown interregnum. All of them not only enjoy their newest passion but also have found it rewarding.</p>

<p><em>With jobs lost, salaries slashed and assignments slackened, supplementing income to bridge as much of the slump as possible is a concern for many.</em> Middleclass Indians are discovering the opportunities in financial markets more and more. The lockdown setting has accelerated the adoption personal savings and investments habits as a life priority. The retail investor base has expanded over the past six months beyond the small group of passionate stock market buffs to include many professionals, small businessmen and gig workers. Salaried women and homemakers are also increasingly being drawn to personal finance.</p>

<p>There are sound reasons that make stock investment an attractive option. Interest rates on bank fixed deposits and other fixed-income instruments have been sliding over the past few years. Financial literacy is slowly but surely expanding. Besides, several blue chips stocks have become affordably priced due to the global financial turbulence and lack lustre performance of local economy. Erstwhile gems of the stock market were beaten down because of the market meltdown. <em>In March this year the stock market was full of blue-chip companies trading at temptingly low valuation.</em></p>

<p>Digital technologies have opened up trading platforms to novice investors. Covid disruptions provided the opportunity to fast-track the retail participation from a trickle to a flow. In less than six months, the stock markets have moved from bust to boom. Have you missed the bus or made your strategic savings and investment initiatives?</p>

<p>Two fundamental concepts in economics - <em>savings and investment</em> - are at the core of economic development. Private savings of individual citizens add up to an important source of capital to spur investment. <em>Income-Savings-Investment</em> cycle is what drives an economy up the value chain.</p>

<p>Independent India slumped into a culture of lethargy and our economy became skewed and non-participative. Most middleclass citizens chose to be outliers to financial market dynamics either due to lack of awareness or low risk-taking behaviours. The abnormally high income-tax rates and the prying eyes of tax officials were powerful disincentives for savings and investment. _A culture of taking every citizen as dishonest unless proved otherwise got hold in public policy. (_Old habits die hard. They still linger)</p>

<p><strong>It led to practically no incentive to save, invest and generate employment.</strong> People clung to their savings and even hoarded their assets partly for fear exorbitant tax rates and also due to lack of sound and safe investment avenues. As a result, we had rather higher savings rates in those years while paradoxically investment dried up and we were derided by the world for the sub- 3% growth rate which came to be nicknamed “Hindu Rate of Growth”. During this time many of the Asian peers were getting integrated to the free world economic dynamism at much faster pace than us.</p>

<p>Much water has flown down the Ganges since those early days of deprivation economy. We are no longer afflicted by fear of scarcity, famine or prevalence of absolute poverty. At least not to the scale of those days. Can you imagine a lockdown of the scale of the current one happening in the India of the 1960s? There would have been riots, looting and widespread unrest.</p>

<p>Today we are a more confident, self-sufficient and aspirational nation. <strong>As home to a vibrant middleclass and with a burgeoning young workforce, it is time to look at whether and how the savings and investment habits of Indians have changed.</strong> How much of their income do average Indian’s save today? What do people do with their savings? Is there a discernible upgrade in the savings and investment practices of the representative Indian population?</p>

<p>As of 2019, India’s saving rate has matured to around 30% from the dismal levels of 7.9% in 1954. <em>The aberration in the Indian economy is the skewed investment behaviour of the upwardly mobile middle class.</em> <strong>Non-productive and less liquid assets like land, buildings and gold still account for bulk of the investments by Indian middleclass.</strong> May be the feudalistic undercurrent in the traditional Indian society still has an emotional influence on the savings and investment habits of the new rich middle-class too. <em>The glitter of gold and the satisfaction of owning land are perhaps too ingrained in Indian psyche.</em></p>

<p>A sign of a healthy open-market economy is the breadth and depth of its financial markets. In India, we still have a skewed financial market with Foreign Institutional Investors, domestic Mutual Funds and a sprinkling of High-Networth Individuals (HNIs) accounting for the bulk of the transactions. Participation of domestic retail investors in the Indian stock markets is quite low.</p>

<p>A Survey of Consumer Finances conducted by the Federal Reserve in 2013 indicated that 48.8 per cent of US families were direct or indirect owners of publicly traded stock. Most of the individual US investors in stocks opted for the mutual funds route to take advantage of professional advisory. Pension Funds of most OECD countries invest in global stock markets to maximise returns to their members. In developing Asia, the share of retail investors is perhaps the highest in China. Some estimates show that retail investors account for 85 per cent of trading in China’s markets.</p>

<p>Though India has one of the oldest stock exchanges in Asia – Bombay Stock Exchange was established as early as in 1875 – <em>our stock trading culture remained restricted and elusive to the wider public until the setting up of NSE and the promotion of demat portfolio holdings and digital trading.</em></p>

<p><strong>With retail participation below 20%, our financial markets are yet to mature into trusted wealth creator for the masses.</strong> The average daily turnover of BSE and NSE together (with NSE being the major player by a wide margin) is currently around Rs. 70,000 Crores. However, the low domestic retail participation deprives most Indians from the benefits of a booming bourse. Many factors such as gaps in financial literacy, social biases about stock market operations being too risky and speculative as well as apprehensions about the soundness of controls and regulations contribute to this sorry state of aloofness of the majority of citizens to financial markets. When the markets do well, the larger public fails to gain. Hopefully over the next five years the situation would become more balanced in favour of retail investors.</p>

<p>Apart from a matured and well-represented equity market, <strong>a well-developed debt market is also prerequisite to ensure healthy flow of savings to meet the needs of corporate capital.</strong></p>

<p>Debt funding is in fact the more dominant of the capital raising mechanisms. Bulk of the debt funding in India gets addressed through bank borrowings. Bank financing is costlier option for both the economy and the businesses. <strong>A transparent and well-regulated bond market with extensive participation of institutional and retail investors would add depth to our capital market.</strong> We still have a nascent bond market. SEBI has a lot of work to do to raise the profile of bond markets in India through structural and governance reinforcement and process simplification.</p>

<p>Lockdown has made online trading a compelling proposition for both engagement and earnings. Like many habits on personal hygiene picked up during lockdown, the new savings and investment habits would also hopefully linger on and expand in scope, volume and spread. It is time to hone the savings and investment acumen of the burgeoning middleclass in India. After all, personal finance competence is a success factor not just during work life but to ensure sound income security post retirement too.</p>
