				<p>As the Sun would set over the American skies on the third of November, 2020 the United States would have delivered its mandate as to who should occupy the White House for the next four years. How convincingly and without rancour would the results emerge is anybody’s guess.</p>

<p>In the complex ‘electoral college’ based process, the perceived popularity or lack of it, the myriads of opinion polls or predictions by poll pundits can be wide off the mark. As happened in 2016, when Hillary Clinton won 3 million more popular votes but still lost to Donald Trump in garnering the threshold count of electoral college votes. The electoral college consists of 538 votes, and an absolute majority of electoral votes, 270 or more, is required to win the election.</p>

<p>The mood of the nation seems to be against Trump’s continuation at this moment. The poor handling of the pandemic outbreak, deep polarisation in the polity and the feeling of deprivation and alienation among the blacks, coloured immigrants and poorer sections seem to have altered the ‘feel good’ factor so evident a couple of years back. The chances are that there is a high likelihood of a change of guard.</p>

<p>In spite of the much-diminished clout of the US on the global scenario, American elections are still an event to reckon with for much of the world. The strategic, economic, commercial and intellectual fallout of a change of leadership in the US would be a series of reset across much of the globe in terms of strategies, alliances and business dynamics.</p>

<p>Since there is a higher possibility for Joe Biden to ascend the throne, it is worthwhile to look at the possible implications for the US, the World and more particularly for India and its neighbourhood.</p>

<p><strong>Are we in for a bout of Bidenomics? What could be its broad contours? How would Asia and India be impacted? What should India do in preparation for the change of mantle, if it does happen?</strong> These are interesting questions for us to ponder over even as 35% of the voters have already cast their votes in the long and winding electoral exercise.</p>

<p>Whatever unpredictability or impulsiveness one might attribute to Trump’s ways of governance, he has been an unabashed votary of free market economy where business reigns supreme creating opportunities, growth avenues and overcoming challenges with agility. When it comes to the Democrats, they profess a tempered version of capitalism with an undercurrent of mild left-of-centre approach. The core voter base of Democrats feels the heat of the current crisis more severely than other sections and would need to be reassured.</p>

<p><strong>Like in India, in most free world economies, election outcomes are more an expression of dissatisfaction with the incumbents than a positive endorsement of the alternative on offer.</strong> Very often, voters punish the ruling dispensation rather than embrace with both hands the other proposition. It is true of the US elections as well. Unless the groundswell of disapproval is high, US voters generally tend to vote in the outgoing President at the end of the first term.</p>

<p>It is too early to hazard a guess as to a clearer picture of what to expect from ‘Bidenomics’ if and when it takes charge. From domestic perspective of the US, the new approach has to be visibly more humane, accommodative and caring. Logically, the tax rates might go up especially for the rich and ‘super rich”, businesses might face more cost push and social spending would escalate. Soothing the scars of the pandemic among the less privileged would consume much attention, spending and effort of the incoming regime.</p>

<p>In the global trade and business flows, tensions are likely to ease a little and one can expect a more accommodative and less abrasive posturing on the part of America. “America First” can make meaning and can result in a critical mass of investment, employment and global business only if the growth hubs in various economies are reenergised. The US has to play a more active role in global rejuvenation, lest China would continue its free run. Trump’s transience in no small measure contributed to Chinese diabolic global overreach. <em>Time is not far off when many smaller economies would cry for help from being overrun by the golden chariot driven by the fire-spitting dragon.</em></p>

<p><strong>One expects the reclaiming by US of its legitimate power and contribution in global multilateral agencies and collaborations. The passive and inward looking “hands off” attitude that Trump adopted in terms of funding and cooperation on global initiatives from trade to green energy drained much of the soft power that traditionally the Americans enjoyed on world stage.</strong> It would be a priority for the new US Administration to correct the imbalance and reset the power equation in many agencies of cooperation where the Chinese have elbowed in by leveraging the vacuum.</p>

<p>The greatest challenge for a possible Biden administration is perhaps going to be dealing with the belligerent China. The Chinese aggressive economic outreach and increasingly obvious military muscle-flexing are causing alarm across much of the free world.</p>

<p>This brings us to the Indian perspective of the emerging scenario with a possible Biden administration in Capitol Hill. <strong>Politically, militarily and economically India today is in a critical position as far as any US Administration is concerned.</strong> Whether Trump or Biden, India would have to be assigned a pivotal position in their global strategic thinking. With the China-Iran-Turkey-Russia line-up in all likelihood emerging as a formidable alliance of sorts over the next few years, the US has to bolster a counter alliance of free-market democracies as a solid and strong global catalyst to rally the liberal and open economies together.</p>

<p>Economically, China plus One policy for de-risking global manufacturing would gather steam, with or without Trump in White House. Not necessarily beneficial for India though, unless we put in place the infrastructure and enabling financial and legal framework for governance upgrade to global standards. More and more economic linkages, cross-investments and outsourcing opportunities would emerge for Indian corporates as the global economy emerges from the pandemic. The challenge for India is to take advantage in a favourable global climate.</p>

<p>Trump has a more presidential style; Biden is more likely to be a consensus president who would govern more in a consultative style. The risk with this approach, as was evident in previous democratic presidential terms like Clinton’s is that the lobbyists at work would tend to tilt the scales to the advantage of interest groups. We all know how the proximity of US and Pakistani military officials gave a tilt away from Indian interests. However, with China embracing Pakistan with a bear hug and Russia strategically showing more affinity to China than India (though India currently has little option but to depend on Russia for legacy military ware), <strong>hopefully the new Democratic dispensation can avoid the temptation to hyphenate the two ‘Nuclear’ rivals of South Asia. I</strong>n the new context, Americans need India as much as we need them. <strong>Current geopolitical realities and the growing maturity of the Indian economy as a “go to” source of high quality products and services</strong>, we are now in a more level ground for a mutually beneficial relationship with developed nations.</p>

<p>India has to play its hand deftly in the re-alignment game with the likely Biden regime. India has a chance now to prove that irrespective of the Party or President in power we are in a long-term win-win partnership with the US.</p>

<p>We need to work our way through the issues of H1B visa restrictions, more access to Indian students and services and market access with preferential tariffs for some more time. On our part, we should be open to make concessions on free trade and investment protection as well as intellectual property terms on par with global best practices.</p>

<p>Well, all this talk is on the premises of a likely defeat of Trump in the elections. If, however, Trump does win, we can expect a more chastened and less boisterous Presidency. In that event, hopefully his assertiveness and continuity of strategic push can be complemented and leveraged with a prepared objectivity in responses from our side.</p>

<p><strong>Head or Tail, India has hopefully enough strategic maturity to handle the US election outcome with tact and discretion.</strong></p>
