				<p>Anyone gleaning the post-Independence history of India would hardly fail to notice the trail of personality cult in politics. The seeds of this malaise could be traced back to the Independence struggle era and even far beyond to the medieval history and religious folklore of the land.</p>

<p>Most of the deities in the Indian pantheon have royal lineage. Throughout the history of foreign occupation notably by the Mughals and the British, we identified leadership with royalty and grandeur. Locally, we had innumerable princely states and our regional folklore is replete with the eulogy of valour and patronage of rulers. Through generations of caste driven social power structure, obeisance to the local first families got etched in the traditional Indian rural psyche.</p>

<p>The belief in the exclusivity and supremacy of the rulers and powers that be transcended generations into the post-independence phase. The final years of the freedom movement and the initial post-independence period of trauma and search for stability served to consolidate the notion that there was no alternative to Congress.</p>

<p>In the first two decades since independence, the predominantly higher caste citizenry wielded disproportionate power and occupied the lion’s share of plum positions in Government. This phase of the nascent nation’s formative years saw the morphing of the party that fought for independence to become the natural heirs to governance. <strong>We as a nation were born with the TINA factor; there was just no alternative, in the mind of most citizens to the institution called Congress and the leadership of Nehru.</strong></p>

<p>Whether by design or not, the adoption of the flag and such innumerable small and not so small steps contributed to the reinforcement of the TINA mind set in favour of one political party to the disadvantage of other possible challengers who could evolve. Gandhi’s advice to start on a clean slate by dissolving the Congress Party perhaps was too naïve but had a very relevant message to the new dispensation assuming charge.</p>

<p>The middle class and the less privileged masses did feel a reassuring sense of elation in the post independent set up, even as the nation was coming to terms with the scars of partition. The overwhelming feeling was that the emerging political structure could be looked upon to provide continuity, security and support to the citizenry. People at large, still in shock over the blatantly communal partition of the motherland, had no confidence to rock the boat. Hence the party that assumed power was born with an assurance of no challenge in the foreseeable future.</p>

<p>In hindsight, our democracy would perhaps have evolved healthier if a national and broad-based alternative to the Grand Old Party emerged in the early decades following independence. Instead, what we saw was the sprouting of provincial and sectarian ideologies rushing in to fill the vacuum. The initial identity politics to surface was assertion of linguistic divisiveness triggered by the formation of states based on language and the consequent clamour for additions and deletions of fringe areas. The erstwhile Bombay got torn between Marathi and Gujarati zeolites, Tamils asserted Dravidianism as a counter to the Aryan identity of the Gangetic plains; Punjab and Haryana stepped on collision course on linguistic lines. The language-based fault lines could by and large be cooled off thanks to the dynamics of a lively democracy, albeit the physical and emotional costs were indeed high for the young nation.</p>

<p>In subsequent years, identity politics took on a more realistic and natural turn with the marginalised sections of society gained in confidence and garnered political patronage to launch the OBC movement. The vast array of middle-of-the-rung communities who got bunched together under the euphemism ‘Other Backward Classes’(OBC) has come to be recognized as the most critical power grouping in the country’s democratic power play. While the linguistic identity politics was largely emotive in nature, the assertion by the caste-based interest groups clamouring for rightful share of wealth, employment and political power had substantial economic and social context and impact.</p>

<p>India, an agglomeration of cultures, history and belief systems, was indeed too large and diverse a canvas to be painted with sweep of a brush. The movements for social justice and assertion of sub-regional aspirations did strike a body blow to the TINA factor in the body politic. Now it was getting increasingly clear that at the localised level multiple factors of social dynamics would throw up powerful challenges to sustained political dominance of monolithic pan-Indian narratives.</p>

<p><strong>The obvious fall out of the assertion by the population at the middle of the spread was the weakening of the behemoth called Congress.</strong> The party behind the freedom movement was probably seen by more and more of the empowered social groups as too broad-based in advancing their localised interests and genuine concerns rooted in a sense of deprivation and exclusion. Thus was born the era of coalition politics in the Indian hinterland and rise of regionalism.</p>

<p><strong>But the next turn for assertion was waiting to unfold – a thrust of majoritarianism crafted by the right wing.</strong> The rightist economic narrative was hard to sell to an audience that was long fed on state patronage as a panacea. Majoritarian religiosity was dusted up as a novel offering that could find some mileage. <strong>The seeds of the right turn in Indian politics can be traced to the tactical missteps of the centre-left ruling class.</strong> The script of poverty preservation and playing up the fears and apprehensions of the minorities had run its course for too long.</p>

<p>When BJP rode to power on majoritarian politics essentially in the heartland states, TINA was in for a rejig. What has resulted is that TINA continues, but now the tables have been turned and the Right has replaced the centre-left grouping as the ‘natural ruling class’.</p>

<p><em>This too would pass. There cannot be TINA in a matured and balanced democracy.</em> <strong>TINA factor is essentially a product of skewed and distorted political process.</strong> Oscillating from one TINA framework to another is like keeping on running without moving an inch.</p>

<p>To reach the goal of an inclusive, positive and supportive political framework, we need to grow out of the TINA mindset. The journey would involve detoxifying caste politics, making family and individual parties irrelevant and consolidation of ideologies over identities. It is still work in progress. As more and more people would see the big picture and appreciate the long-term perspective of the benefits to everyone from a liberal, inclusive approach, we would move a few notches up the path of an evolved India, politically.</p>

<p>Such an India will offer objective and rational choices to the people beyond the limitations of TINA.</p>
