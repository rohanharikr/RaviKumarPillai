				<p>An open and liberal democracy is faced with innumerable challenges and inflection points in its journey. Multiple identities such as sub-regionalism, ethnic affinity, trade and professional affiliation, to name just a few, would pitch lobby groups against each other. Ideological overhangs might render people myopic to others’ genuine concerns. Sectarian perceptions and interests might collide with the larger national agenda of governance.</p>

<p><strong>An uneasy equilibrium of workable co-existence amidst diversity is what a healthy democracy seeks to achieve.</strong> The availability of means to articulate and promote propositions makes democracy the sensible option for consensus building and accommodation. That underlying reality makes India different from totalitarian regimes. The spirit of our Constitution and the shared values we uphold make inclusiveness, accommodation, care and concern amidst differences the natural path of reconciliation for us.</p>

<p>If you ask me to name the most critical competency that the citizens of a liberal democracy should have, I would mark out <em>negotiation skills</em>. To understand the significance of the ability to discuss, debate and resolve differences, let us look at the ongoing agitation by farmers over the recent farm laws. The legislation was aimed at providing a more open regime for trade in farm products.</p>

<p>While the reforms have been a long felt need for making our agriculture productive, efficient and remunerative, <strong>the whole exercise has turned out to be a case study in how not to manage conflicting perceptions and interests of stakeholders.</strong></p>

<p>The Supreme Court’s offer of a Committee of farmer groups and Government representatives to review the provisions in the laws and its suggestion to keep the implementation on hold in the meanwhile to facilitate consensus building represent a serious attempt to break the deadlock. But the very involvement of judiciary in smoothing the ruffled feathers in the farming community could set an unhealthy precedent.</p>

<p>The democratic framework provides for a mechanism for discussions, debates and protests to be handled within the ambit of the legislative and executive governance. Press and media are expected to play a powerful role in proactively highlighting the nuances of the public policy needing attention and review. Except for the rare instances of emergency legislations, the ordinance route and summary legislation should be avoided.</p>

<p>If enough debates are not provided for and consensus is not curated in the corridors and chambers of legislature, the apprehensions of aggrieved parties would spill over to the streets. Democracy in action transcends legislative and executive boundaries. Once allowed to snowball, discontent can trigger irrational responses and embolden fringe elements to hijack mass protests.</p>

<p>Let us look at the ongoing farmers’ protests and examine the roles, challenges and opportunities of the principal stakeholders - individual farmers, farmers’ associations, political parties, Government, traders and APMC (_Mandi_s) all have lessons to learn from the current stalemate.</p>

<p>The issue can be looked at from the content, context, communication and process angles. We need to examine to what went wrong, how can the situation be retrieved and the matter brought to a closure with the least bruises on the ego, self-respect and interests of all concerned.</p>

<p>The content and context of the legislation are hardly mattering of great discord. However, <strong>the Government seemingly displayed a tearing hurry by dispensing with detailed and patient consultation and consensus-building in the legislative process leading to the passage of the Bills.</strong> The sensitivities and perceptions of the powerful and politically connected farm lobbies of Punjab which has a substantial share of Government procurement should have been addressed early enough in the legislation cycle.</p>

<p><strong>Once distrust creeps in, political governance enters the territory of opacity, posturing and one-upmanship.</strong> It is a hard lesson learnt by the Government that Parliamentary majority and winning successive elections are not guarantees to push through far-reaching reforms with ease. <strong>Democratic process for reforms is the most effective when managed through a bottom-up process of communication and consensus creation.</strong> Though time consuming and complex, the outcome would be sustainable and acceptable across societal segments.</p>

<p>As for the agitating farmers and the leaders representing them, they were too emotionally carried away by the suddenness of change and apparently lost the negotiating advantages of the aggrieved party due to rigidity of approach adopted.</p>

<p><em>If you have to lead the agitations to a positive and logical conclusion, it is important not to push the other party beyond a point and to a corner.</em> <strong>No negotiation has ever been won by one party blocking the other from an honourable exit route.</strong></p>

<p><em>‘I Win-You Lose’</em> is not a winnable formula for any type of negotiation. Insisting on my way or no way is a bad strategy. Such an approach forecloses the opportunity for collectively examining a range of possibilities to progress to a closure. Obstinacy is a two-edged sword and cuts deeply into the self-esteem of both negotiating parties.</p>

<p>As for political parties in the Opposition, there would be natural tendency to see the stalemate as an opportunity to embarrass the ruling party. An Opposition Party can benefit in the long term if it talks tough but refrains from negative tactics. stance. <em>Creating bad precedence and seeking short term gains while forsaking long term strategic advantages might be perceived as rank opportunism.</em> If the pain of prolonged stalemate lingers, obstructionist tactics are more likely to bite the protagonists. In political negotiations, swift and visible benefits are seen as signs of success.</p>

<p>APMCs or Mandis as well as traders would also do well to look at the strategic opportunities of reforms and approach possible solution with openness, flexibility and adaptability. A reform of such a sensitive and massive impact is loaded with possibilities for mutual benefit for stakeholders.</p>

<p>Finally, when differences are pursued too aggressively and the doors appear to be closing in due to rigidity and lack of flexibility, it helps to bring in a third party, respected for objectivity. We seem to be wearing round to such an eventuality. Who better than the Apex Court to take on that role? It would be indeed be advisable for the Government to swallow a bit of pride and offer a period of “stand still” enabling the Supreme Court to appoint a Committee of stakeholders to attempt finding a viable middle path to keep reforms moving while assuaging hurt sensibilities.</p>

<p>Democracy is the spirit of India. It needs to be preserved, protected and practiced with all its diversity, mutual respect and openness to change. The farmers seem to have taught India a lesson in basic democracy that in the first place we should never have forgotten, even for a moment.</p>
