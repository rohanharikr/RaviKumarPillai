				<p>We were having our sporadic weekend old boys’ meetup, a rare fixture in these days of pandemic. The freewheeling discussions touched upon a range of topics. May be triggered by the prevailing social milieu or in an accidental detour, we stumbled upon an interesting, yet uncomfortable, question.</p>

<p><em>“Are you a nationalist?” , asked my effervescent friend. “ Well, I don’t think so,” I replied. “Okay, then you are not patriotic?”, pat came the response.</em> Though my temptation was to feign inattentiveness in a bid to avoid the futile discussion forward, my spontaneous response was, <strong>“Well, patriotism itself is a bit worn-out idea. Nevertheless, how the hell are you equating nationalism with patriotism?”</strong></p>

<p>Thankfully, the discussions took a fast retreat from the alley that would have led to fierce posturing and boisterous arguments. Later that night, as I lay gazing at the emptiness of the enveloping darkness, that evening’s fleeting discussions triggered stray thoughts on the whole issue of virulent nationalism.</p>

<p><em>What is nationalism, anyway? Is it positive or inherently divisive? Can there be a world beyond nationalism?</em> These nagging questions are inconvenient and disturbing and so most people conveniently avoid them even in their self-talk.</p>

<p>Nationalism as a concept evolved as a result of the <em>search for identity and affiliation</em> of the early tribal and clannish societies. As they struggled to fend off external invasions and intimidations by others seeking to establish their own moorings and dominance, they defined their version of nationalism in tight terms as if to trap their folks in a tight embrace difficult to untangle .</p>

<p>Historically, as nomads and colonisers gobbled up contiguous geographies for farming, settlement and assertion of brute power, the idea of nationalism took roots in different hues and haze. <strong>Both the invaders and the locals crafted their own notions and folklore around the valour, supremacy and traditions of their kind ‘nationalism.’ The notions of ‘us’ and ‘them’ got accentuated through the reinforcement of nationalism.</strong></p>

<p>It is an irony that nationalism which got established as a shield of inclusive identity ended up thriving on a number of corollary ideas of antithesis - exclusion, hostility and intolerance towards diversity. If one looks behind the veil of the superficial unity brought out by the neo-nationalist movements across the world, one would discern icy power struggles and domineering individual assertions for control.</p>

<p><em>Over the course of evolution of humanity, geographical and lifestyle identities gave way to religion and belief systems as the overarching layer of identity.</em> While religion intertwined with political nationalism in the pre-liberal era, subsequently religion and statecraft developed a working arrangement of mutual exclusiveness at least in theory. The monarchies which ruled most settlements before the onset of democratic liberalism were quick to sense the utility of religious and ethnic identities as powerful means to divide, insulate and subjugate the masses thereby fending off simmering discontent and anti-incumbency against the regimes.</p>

<p>As humanity journeyed into the 19th century and beyond, nationalism of the tribal variety gave way to economic nationalism. The new idea of nationalism based on economic domains was consistent with the outlook of the better educated, diversely skilled and aspirational generations. I believe that <strong>whatever humanity has achieved in terms of physical and social well-being since Industrial Revolution is largely the result of free thinking, openness to see ‘the other’ perspectives and unbridled inquisitiveness.</strong> <em>More than “Why”, it is “Why not” that has shaped the modern society.</em></p>

<p>As perspectives broadened and the scope of interactions widened, we saw the blossoming of the age of liberalism. Conservative Right, Liberal Centre and  deviant Left ideology learned to live and let live. Democracy came to be accepted as the more humane, accommodative and acceptable way of governance.</p>

<p><strong>However, the politics of exclusions, privileges and fictitious cultural supremacy still hold sway among a sizeable number of conformists who view change as unnecessary, non-divine and too disturbing.</strong> Divisive nationalism is fanned by traditionalists across geographies. While ultra-right interests have crept into the political space provided by the liberal democracies,   nations  ruled by autocratic despots, military generals or by puppet regimes propped up by the military encourage and reinforce fierce nationalism founded on exclusion of non-conformists. <em>The continuing stories of threats, devastation and human sufferings in the name of religious, political or pseudo-cultural divisions speak of the hold the psychology of primitive tribalism still has over the presumably modern societies.</em></p>

<p>Look at history’s catastrophic failures such as Hitler’s Germany, Tsarist Russia or the pre-revolution Chinese Empire – <em>all of them suffered interminably from inflated self-image of cultural supremacy and the myth of infallibility of the ruling dispensation.</em> <strong>Excessive and impassioned nationalism and pumped-up adulation for the glory of the past spelled disaster, humiliation and demise of many a political dispensation in the long and chequered history of humanity.</strong></p>

<p>In contemporary societies, nationalism’s vitriolic divisiveness is still exploited by politicians. Religious nationalism and even sub-regional identity politics based on caste, language and sects come in handy for cunning politicians to carve out and nurture vote banks. <em>Nationalism and the stratification of the same along divisive identities eat into the cohesion of societies and hamper the potential for evolving unifying and secular agenda for development.</em></p>

<p><strong>Today’s world presents immense possibilities for skilling, entrepreneurship  and cross-border commerce on the back of digital connectivity and applications. When the knowledge ecosystem has potential to deliver unprecedented opportunities for upward social and economic mobility, it is indeed an anachronism to allow narrow and restrictive notions of nationalism to apply brakes on progress and prosperity.</strong></p>

<p>“Nationalism is a psychological aberration, and we owe it to our ancestors, and to our descendants - and to the other species, and to the Earth itself - to move beyond it”, says Steve Taylor of Leeds Beckett University who authored the book ‘The Leap and Spiritual Science’</p>

<p>India’s age-old cultural moorings are on <em>‘vasudhaiva kudumbakam’ (The World is one large family).</em> <strong>Developing global perspectives, cultivating inclusiveness and feeling proud about the diversity of our society are critical for our deliverance from the entropy of poverty and mediocrity.</strong></p>

<p>Just like nationalism, patriotism too is a two-edged sword. <strong>Patriotism is indeed a very subjective idea that can be conveniently defined and brandished. In most imperfect polities, patriotism is used as a term to count you in as a supporter of the ruling dispensation or rule you out as being against it.</strong> <em>In a sense, patriotism has restrictive overtones that are anathema to the concept of universal brotherhood.</em> When the ruling class usurps the moral authority to determine who is patriot and who is not, the concept is extinguished at one go.</p>

<p>In my interactions with a number of educated and intelligent youngsters, <em>I am pained to see a creeping willingness to accept, support and propagate politics of hate, exclusion and cultural divisiveness. It is unfortunate and myopic.</em></p>

<p><strong>I would rather be a non-nationalist and a humanist at heart.</strong> A global citizen at best, who is equally disturbed by a pair of sunken eyes in Africa and by the sight of hungry children struggling to grab a food dole-out in an anonymous Indian city.</p>
