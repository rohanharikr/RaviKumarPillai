				<p>Over the years since Independence, India has created a labyrinth of restrictive structures, complex processes and loose governance practice. The disconnect between the <em>aam aadmi,</em> our largely insensitive bureaucracy and the sprinkling of self-seeking politicians has only grown wider over the years.</p>

<p>In no other sector has this dichotomy wreaked more havoc than in farming. As the source of livelihood for the bulk of our rural households and as the bulwark of our food security, agriculture sector has struggled along like the proverbial bullock cart winding its way through the pothole ridden road to the nearest <em>mandi.</em></p>

<p>In spite of being among the largest global producers in many of the crops, globally India has had a negligible presence as an exporter of Agri-merchandise<strong>. Within India itself, we have a highly fragmented market for agricultural products.</strong> This structure has provided a fertile ground for middlemen to thrive.</p>

<p><em>Bulk of the economic value created in the farm sector has been scooped off by the middlemen</em> in the channel leaving the primary producer severely mired in debt, penury and helpless dependence on traders, politicians and administrators.</p>

<p>Expert panels, economists and forward-looking politicians have long advocated to clean the mess and formalize processes that would raise the frontline farmer’s share of the income generated from farm produce. But <em>successive Governments shied away from demonstrating the political will to stir the hornet’s nest</em> and upset the vested interests of the lobbyists, operators and sponsors.</p>

<p>The farm reform bills introduced in the Parliament target pathbreaking reforms in agricultural produce marketing to free up trade from all restrictions. <em>The legislation provides for opening up the farm sector to competition, modernisation of supply chains, enabling agribusinesses to engage with farmers directly and creating seamless access to markets.</em></p>

<p>Why are the politicians in Punjab and Haryana jittery about supporting a revolutionary move to liberate farmers from the clutches of the procurement lobbies? Why are farmers at large in these States worried about the changes proposed?</p>

<p>We need to understand the rationale as well as the emotional aspects of the reactions at the ground level. <strong>I do not consider the resistance to change as unusual or unjustified. It is integral to an open democracy that Government should initiate dialogue, discussions and reassurances to assuage the feelings of the citizens affected by a proposed change</strong> as significant as the current proposal to overhaul the mechanism of agricultural markets.</p>

<p>The Farming Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill seeks to allow inter-state and intra-state trade of primary agricultural commodities. The produce has been traditionally sold mainly in notified wholesale markets run by Agricultural Produce Marketing Committees (APMCs). <em>The restrictive procedures of APMCs require farmers to sell only to licensed middlemen in these notified markets.</em> <strong>This in effect shuts out the opportunity for farmers to get the best price that the larger market can offer.</strong></p>

<p>By insulating the primary producer from the end-user, APMC structure incentivises the traders or middle men to indulge in a range of unhealthy practices ranging from speculative trade, hoarding as well as price-fixing through manipulations and cartels. In addition, the lack of modern and organized storage, warehousing and logistics infrastructure results in wastage of more than a third of grains and almost half of perishables. The informal and archaic trading and movement setup dominated by informal players can ill afford the capital, technology and facilities for upgraded logistics practices.</p>

<p><em>More than anything else, the real farmer gets a pittance and the intermediaries corner the profits from the trade.</em> Instances of desperate farmers opting to burn or dump their produce rather than sell to the traders at throw away price, often below cost price, are not uncommon.</p>

<p>Here is a much-needed change being misunderstood or misinterpreted by many of the stakeholders. This brings us to the basic issue of <em>how to manage transformational changes in an open economy with most stakeholders lacking awareness and competence</em> to make the best use of the unfolding opportunities.</p>

<p><strong>Change Management examples from corporate and public governance domains would show how the best of intentions can fail to ensure the success of transformation initiatives in the lack of effective and extensive communication.</strong></p>

<p>A democracy offers the unique opportunity to engage citizens in change process. <em>The major changes over the past five years including Demonetization and GST roll-out perhaps would have been better implemented with a well structured and effectively carried out change communication program.</em></p>

<p>The current farm reforms offer an opportunity to the Federal Government to avoid the communication pitfalls of the recent past. Open and engaged dialogue with State Governments, Farmers’ representatives and various other stakeholders would clear the air for smoother rollout of critical farm reform. Such a major changeover to new system would require creation of the required comfort level for the stakeholders.</p>

<p>Frontline farmers are seemingly restless and apprehensive of disruptions expected in the APMC setup in the wake of the reforms. With the inevitable politicising of the issue, the situation can brim onto the streets. Hence it is all the more important to start dialogue and disseminate information about the changes transparently to the frontline farmers.</p>

<p><em>Considering the fact that Punjab along Haryana contribute approximately two-thirds of total wheat procurement and three-fourth of rice procurement to the central pool, it is imperative to listen to and address the fears, apprehensions and misgivings of farmers there.</em></p>

<p><strong>Transition management should involve a reassurance by Federal Government about continuity and minimal disruption in terms of quantity and price of procurement</strong> in the interim. Unless the structure, processes and guidelines are in place and there is effective framework for central monitoring and coordination with states, the transition can turn murky. A few unpleasant experiences can spoil the party. Especially in the Covid impacted rural economy, emotional distress is already high.</p>

<p><em>Guaranteed procurement at Minimum Support Price (MSP) for various crops</em> is a minimum condition for smooth transition. MSP system should be guaranteed for at least five years or till a matured market-based system that can visibly be more remunerative to farmers evolves.</p>

<p><strong>An escrow system guaranteed by federal government should be put in place</strong> to ensure seamless payment process to farmers and to prevent defaults and fraudulent operations.</p>

<p>Governance is the key to successful change management. A State level Nodal office should be appointed by the State Governments concerned to ensure smooth roll out of the transition and redressal of farmers’ grievances.</p>

<p>With proper preparations and a well-planned transition management, the current attempt to reform the farm produce marketing has the potential to be a gamechanger in upgrading rural economy and improving living standards.</p>

<p>After all, more than seven decades after independence the farmer deserves dignity, financial security and incentivisation to move up the value chain.</p>

<p><strong>For too long have they served as fodder to the middlemen.</strong></p>
