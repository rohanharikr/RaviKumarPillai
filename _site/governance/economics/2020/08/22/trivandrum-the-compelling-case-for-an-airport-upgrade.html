				<p>In the south western corner of India lies Kerala, God’s Own Country. A land of paradoxes, hyperbole and hypocrisy. Legend has it that every year, on Thiru Onam day, in the month of August-September King Mahabali, who is supposed to have ruled over this land ages back returns to see the state of his people. And the citizenry, young and old, deceive him by dressing up in their best and pretending to be all hunky-dory. An annual ritual of fooling the visiting former ruler, while in fact everything remains as muddy and messy as ever. What a tale? What a twist?</p>

<p>Once every five years there is the great festival of democracy and Kerala has never disappointed in providing grand spectacles of election rallies and excitement. The repetitive election outcomes in Kerala has however been by and large highly predictable - the triumph of negative voting. <strong>Most of the times the ruling front votes itself out rather than the opposition riding on positive sentiments.</strong></p>

<p>In Kerala, political parties have become irrelevant decades back. We have instead a two-player electoral race where two “Fronts” – the “avowedly” Left and the “softer” Left vie with each other.</p>

<p>When out of power, the Opposition Front floods the media with accusations of nepotism, corruption and inactivity on the part of the Ruling front; but once the roles are revered the narratives too get transposed. Content, narrative and pantomimes maintain the customary familiarity.</p>

<p><strong>Political narratives are the staple cheese of the quintessential Malayali. One of the most enduring political discourses centre around the theme ‘Public vs Private’.</strong> The average Malayali loves it. The pretentious intellectuals relish it. <em>We vow to be the purest of anti-capitalists around.</em> Yet Kerala is visibly the Mecca of commercialisation and brand equity. Most Malayalis work for Private Sector whether in India or abroad – a miniscule proportion is employed in Government and Public Sector. Yet our favourite pastime is whipping the big industrialists. When I was a child in elementary school, I used to walk to my school enjoying the rhythmic sloganeering of “Down with Tata and Birla.” To-day when I drive my grandchild to school, I hear, “Down, down Adani and Ambani”. Does time stand still here? May be hues change, but the atmosphere is eerily static.</p>

<p>We brag about social good, ethics and compassion. But nepotism, bribes and backdoor entries are as much part of the Malayali milieu as in the rest of India.</p>

<p>As a student, I had seen in the 1970s how computerization was opposed tooth and nail by our politicized public opinion. Our enlightened leaders exhorted us to break and shatter computers, the villainous capitalist innovation that would robe the poor millions of employments. Today, computers provide livelihood and aspirations to much of the youth. <em>Ironically, IT has raised more people from mundane to decent standards of living in the land of the red than the leaky schemes for poverty alleviation.</em></p>

<p>When a modern airport was proposed at Nedumbasseri (Kochi), the progressive leaders declared that planes would be permitted to land only over their dead bodies. Today, the Keralites of all shades place the swanky airport as a showpiece of our development. Not only that those who smashed a few public transport vehicles agitating against the airport when proposed ,later enjoyed key positions in the Board of Directors.</p>

<p>When a Nuclear power plant was proposed with Russian aid, we vehemently opposed. Today, the plant sits just at our border with Tamil Nadu. The risk is not far, but the feeling of fictitious victory was sufficient to vet the Malayali psyche.</p>

<p>We have killed the granaries of Kuttanad and Palghat with our restrictive labour policies. Not even one large, successful manufacturing unit has been established in Kerala, in public or private sector, in the past three decades. <strong>If the Gulf opportunities dry up, which is now more certain than likely, the average Keralite graduate will probably be forced to regress to the early 1960’s routine of jumping on to a train to seek opportunities in some distant corner of India.</strong></p>

<p><em>Let us take the latest case of the public vs private debate.</em> The focus is on upgrade of the logistics infrastructure, more particularly upgrading the airport infrastructure and air connectivity of Trivandrum city, the capital of God’s Own Country.</p>

<p><strong>India has witnessed a quantum jump in the quality of flight infrastructure in past couple of decades. As a global traveller, I can vouch for the airports in Mumbai or Bengaluru being on par with some of the best airports in the world.</strong> Delhi, Hyderabad and many other airports today are going through the catch-up phase viz-a-viz global benchmarks.</p>

<p>When it comes to rapid and massive upgrade of the infrastructure – roads, rail, ports, power, airports and the like – the capital infusion needed is humongous. We also need to upgrade the technology and operating practices to match the best-in-class.</p>

<p><strong>There is massive capital available globally and the time is ripe to enhance the global capital inflow to support our infrastructure development</strong><em>.</em> In today’s world, global fund flow is predominantly not a Government-to-Government ‘aid’ or ‘grant’ package as was the practice a few decades ago. <em>Today, capital flows are controlled, managed and supported by the best-in-class corporates, investors, sovereign wealth funds and economic groupings.</em></p>

<p>The world is the stage and opportunities for fund deployment are many. <strong>The smart capital of the world seeks opportunities for secure, stable and sustained growth. The lever for that lies in entrepreneurship, agility and adaptability of the corporate sector as well as the quality of governance and consistency of support by the political leadership.</strong></p>

<p>It is much more sensible to enable massive private capital to be deployed in infrastructure upgrade than to commit public finance and rely on bureaucratic way of operations. At the end of the day, the average citizen of India should be able to access and enjoy the utilities and services that those in developed world are able to.</p>

<p><strong>Committing public funding to infrastructure upgrade has many handicaps.</strong> Firstly, the capacity of most economies, especially in the developing world, to deploy the huge outlay needed for building the facilities is rather limited. Burdened with massive internal and external debt and reeling under the public health emergency due to pandemic, the priority of most Governments in the foreseeable future would be to improve liquidity, provide economic support and ensure social necessities reach the needy. Even post-Covid, the social agenda for bringing up the education, health and governance standards to meet the emerging challenges would leave little scope for the much-needed investment to build infrastructure. <strong>There is just no other way than to tap private capital to shore up infrastructure.</strong></p>

<p>India is fortunate to have a dynamic, vibrant, agile, varied and professional corporate private sector with expertise in a range of fields. This is a unique advantage that can be leveraged to speed up infrastructure. With global availability of easier liquidity, increased willingness of OECD nations to partner with India as a counter hub to China and leveraging the young, aspirational and educated working population, now is India’s chance to take on the world with aggressive competitiveness.</p>

<p><strong>The time has come to let political class know that aspirational India would prefer to ride on positivism and risk-taking. Kerala with the best Human Development Index in India needs to give a break to excessive politicisation and embrace economics for the sake of posterity.</strong> Let the case of Trivandrum Airport not be lost in the futile and time-worn arguments for and against public and private sector.</p>

<p>We need results, we need to move on. <strong>Our politicians should learn to appreciate privatization and private capital in public, not just in private conversations.</strong> Dr. Sasi Tharoor, the MP from Trivandrum has shown tremendous strength of conviction. Many Business leaders and Opinion makers have spoken out too. <em>But the day the lone voices coalesce into a movement for change, a new city will be born.</em></p>
