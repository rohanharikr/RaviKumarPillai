_"Traditional conglomerates have no future. On average, they are average. And today, average means mediocracy" - Joe Kaeser, CEO of Siemens_

The top ten Indian companies by market capitalisation as of Feb/2021 reads: _RIL, TCS, HDFC Bank, Infosys, HUL, HDFC, Kotak Mahindra Bank, SBI, Bajaj Finance and Bharti Airtel._

**The list is dominated overwhelmingly by pure-play enterprises rather than business conglomerates.** We have many legacy industrial houses which have grown haphazardly like wild bushes mostly in the pre-liberalisation years. Many of them accumulated licences/permits and grew into unwieldy behemoths.

However, _it goes to the credit of free market dynamics and the gradual maturing of capital markets in the country that many of them lost out to the newer, nimbler and more focused businesses over time._

Why is it that large business houses with an assortment of businesses in their portfolio seem less appealing to discerning investors? Some of the key factors for the loss of investor interest in them are rigidity of corporate structure, power-centric governance processes, blurring of strategic focus and dilution of economic value accretion from non-synergic businesses.

Globally, the strategic weight of the conglomerate business model as against pure-play business enterprises has been on the decline. **In the US and in Europe since 1980s companies have preferred the stand-alone business format to consolidated group structure.**

_Rise in_ _public activism against monopoly practices_ and the _perception of incremental shareholder value in decoupling of sunrise businesses from the legacy_ _ones_ were the key drivers behind this shift. Further, standalone business structure can _better align to sector-specific industry interests. Management and regulatory processes are a lot less complex_ compared to the group entity.

**It is time for large business houses to relook at their structure and business model and to take a call on strategic restructuring.** This is needed to regain the animal spirit that spurred them to expansion in the first place. The context has changed and so have new challenges emerged. _Digitalisation opportunities, generational shift in talent and fast-changing competitive landscape_ call for **agility, collaboration and customer alignment** for survival and growth of businesses.

In this context, group level consolidation as a model and strategy merits a fresh and objective look. Before we take up a few examples from the contemporary corporate landscape, we need to understand clearly the concept of _conglomerate discount._

The enterprise valuation of a conglomerate is done by computing the ‘sum-of-parts’ value of individual businesses in the group. **Analysts tend to assign a lesser value to the consolidated business at group level compared to the sum total of the enterprise values of independent businesses.** That is because of the lack of synergy and the differential ‘performance outcome’ of the different businesses resulting in an overall depletion in the overall valuation. The larger, more diverse and complex a conglomerate structure is, the conglomerate discount too becomes more pronounced.

**In this age of super specialisation and digital technologies, small is indeed more beautiful and more effective. The giant corporates tend to be too slow to respond to the calls for instant responses.**

Look at the table of high market-cap companies given above. There are some vital learning points as we gleam the list once more.

_Take the case of ITC._ It has been consistently coming down in the pecking order and has disappeared from the list of 2020. What do you think would have gone wrong when it comes to how the investment community perceives it?

_Well, ITC’s core business of cigarettes is under perennial regulatory threat_ and has serious constraints on future growth potential. However, it has ventured into diverse and unconnected sectors like hospitality where it finds the going tough. **The FMCG business is indeed doing well but in the absence of unlocking through demerger, the massive potential for growth is stymied.**

_Further, look at Reliance Industries_. In spite of figuring on the top of the table, _the sectoral valuation in respect of Oil and Petrochemicals, Telecom and Retail are at varying stages of maturing and the consolidated effect is a restraint on perceived economic value_ growth in the near term. The slow monetisation of fibre optic network is a huge drag on valuation.

In the short-term till the demerger and listing of Jio platform is achieved, the enterprise value is likely to be seen as subdued by the market. The much-hyped possible investment by global Oil majors in the Oil and Petrochemicals vertical seems mired in uncertainty. _As of now, RIL to me is like a student with high potential performing below par in his exams._

Another case to examine in the context of enterprise value perception is _Larsen and Toubro(L&T)_. It has done well to list L&T Infotech (LTI), L&T Tech. Services (LTTS) and L&T Financial Holdings (LTFH) as separate entities. _The shareholder value created by these strategic listings is indeed great_. Look at how the market cap of LTI has soared for example. However, the parent company is still struggling to find its moorings and upward mobility of market capitalisation would be in sync with the expected jump in order pipeline over the next few years.

What do all these examples throw up as lessons for the conglomerates in India?

Firstly, **sticking to core competencies is vital for corporate identity and value creation in an increasingly competitive and connected economy.**

Strategy Consulting firms recommend that enterprises with unwieldy and unproductive product and services portfolio should prune their offerings to a viable and critical range. _As a thumb rule, one can say that if you are not in the top three (or at least top five) players in the sector, it is prudent for you to exit._ This is a pragmatic touchstone for assessing and recalibrating strategies of conglomerates.

The story of how the rush of telecom licence aspirants spoiled the show and burned their pockets when India liberalised telecom sector will ever remain as a rude reminder of the dangers of crony capitalism and unbridled investment adventurism. Today we just have two major private players – Jio and Airtel- plus Vi ( formerly Vodafone-Idea) still in a hesitant and unsure terrain. As for the public sector player, it remains and would continue probably as an “also ran”.

_Secondly,_ **Companies need to shuffle, prune and refine their offerings to align with their core competence and market needs.** Here again, _the strategic thinking of Tata Group to focus on the parts rather than overstressing the helicopter view needs to be commended._ Renewed vigour and clear focus are visible in each of the key verticals in the group. Having inducted youthful leaderships and cleaned up the strategy and processes, the group seems to have enabled standalone companies to pursue market dominance and execution excellence.

_Thirdly,_ **the strategic need is to leverage technology, talent and leadership to digitalise and derive the synergies and opportunities from the emerging business ecosystem.** _Platform-based, app driven integration of businesses for seamless customer interface_ as well as increasing use of cloud technologies would usher in digitisation and upgrade of businesses.

The restructuring of the massive business groups into fewer and more focused pure-play businesses and the leveraging of technology to simplify and enhance processes would be a win-win for corporates and shareholders alike.

The age of the big and overbearing conglomerates is over. Now is the time for compact, focused and agile corporations.
